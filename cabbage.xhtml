Cabbage is a Csound frontend that provides users with the means to
work with Csound, to develop audio plugins and standalone software
across the three major operating systems. Whilst Cabbage makes use
of underlying plugin technologies, such as Steinberg's VST SDK,
ASIO, etc, Csound is used to process all incoming and outgoing
audio, therefore existing Csound instruments can be adapted to work
with Cabbage with relative ease. Cabbage also provides a growing
palette of GUI widgets ranging from simple sliders to XY-pads and
graph tables. All GUI widgets in a Cabbage plugin can be controlled
via host automation in a plugin host, thereby providing a quick and
effective means of automating Csound instrument parameters in both
commercial and non-commercial DAWs. A user-forum exists at <a href="http://www.thecabbagefoundation.org">www.thecabbagefoundation.org</a>,
and users are invited to discuss, contribute, and share instruments
and music.<br/>
<h2>The Cabbage Standalone Host.</h2>
The main Cabbage application that launches when you open Cabbage is
known as the standalone host. This simple application 'hosts'
Cabbage plugins in the same way any DAW hosts a plugin, but it is
restricted to one plugin at a time (the host can be instantiated
multiple times however). The host also features a source code
editor for editing your code, and it also allows users to enter a
GUI designer mode within which they can design interfaces using a
simple drag-and-drop system. Access to the Csound output console
and Reference Manual through the Cabbage host facilitate debugging
and learning and the host also facilitates control of audio and
MIDI settings used by Csound. If a user wishes to make their
Cabbage patch available as a plugin for use within other software
they can use the 'Export' option which will prompt them to export
their instrument as an audio plugin. In addition to interacting
with hosts via audio and MIDI connections, Cabbage plugins can also
respond to host controls such as tempo, song position and play/stop
status. The plugin formats are currently restricted to VST and
Linux Native VST. Whilst the main purpose of the Cabbage standalone
host is for prototyping and development, it can also be used as a
fully blown production environment depending on the complexity of
the hosted instrument.<br/>

<h2>Cabbage Instruments.</h2>
Cabbage instruments are nothing more than Csound instruments with
an additional &lt;Cabbage&gt;&lt;/Cabbage&gt; section that exists
outside of the &lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt; tags. Each line of text in
this section defines a GUI widget. Special identifiers can be used
to control the look and behavior of each widget. This text
ultimately defines how the graphical interface will look but recent
innovations facilitate the modification of widget appearance from
within the Csound orchestra. This opens up interesting
possibilities including dynamically hiding and showing parts of the
GUI and moving and resizing widgets during performance
time. Instruments can be exported as either effects or synths.
Effects process incoming audio, while synths won't produce any
sound until they are triggered via the MIDI widget, or a MIDI
keyboard. Cabbage makes no differentiation between synths and
effects, but VST hosts do, so one must be careful when exporting
instruments. A full list of available widgets, identifiers and
parameters can be found in the Cabbage reference manual that comes
with all Cabbage binaries.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>A Basic Cabbage Synthesiser</h3>
Example code to create the most basic Cabbage synthesiser is
presented below. This instrument uses the MIDI interop command line
flags to pipe MIDI data directly to p-fields in instrument 1. In
this case all MIDI pitch data is sent directly to p4, and all MIDI
amplitude data is sent to p5. (An alternative approach is to use
Csounds opcodes <a href="http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/cpsmidi.html" target="" title="">cpsmidi</a>, <a href="http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/ampmidi.html" target="" title="">ampmidi</a> etc. to read midi data into an instrument.) MIDI
data sent on channel 1 will cause instrument 1 to play. Data sent
on channel 2 will cause instrument 2 to play. If one prefers they
may use the massign opcode rather than the MIDI interop flags, but
regardless of what mechanism is used, you still need to declare
"-+RTMIDI=NULL -M0" in the CsOptions.<br/>
<br/>
<pre>&lt;Cabbage&gt;
form size(400, 120), caption("Simple Synth"), pluginID("plu1")
keyboard bounds(0, 0, 380, 100)
&lt;/Cabbage&gt;
&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
&lt;CsOptions&gt;
-n -d -+rtmidi=NULL -M0 --midi-key-cps=4 --midi-velocity-amp=5
&lt;/CsOptions&gt;
&lt;CsInstruments&gt;
sr = 44100
ksmps = 64
nchnls = 2
0dbfs=1

instr 1
kenv linenr p5, 0.1, .25, 0.01

endin

&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;
&lt;CsScore&gt;
f1 0 1024 10 1
f0 3600
&lt;/CsScore&gt;
&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;         </pre>
<br/>
You will notice that a -n and -d are passed to Csound in the
&lt;CsOptions&gt; section. -n stops Csound from writing audio to
disk. This must be used when Cabbage is managing audio. If users
wish to use Csound audio IO modules they need to disable Cabbage
audio from the settings menu. The -d prevents any FLTK widgets from
displaying. You will also notice that our instrument is stereo. ALL
Cabbage instruments operate in stereo.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Controlling Your Instrument</h3>
<br/>
The most obvious limitation to the above instrument is that users
cannot interact directly with Csound. In order to do this one can
use a Csound channel opcode and a Cabbage control such as a slider.
Any control that is to interact with Csound must have a channel
identifier.<br/>
<br/>
When one supplies a channel name to the channel() identifier Csound
will listen for data being sent on that channel through the use of
the named channel opcodes. In order to retrieve data from the named
channel bus in Csound one can use the chnget opcode. It is defined
in the Csound reference manual as:<br/>
<br/>
<pre>kval chnget Sname</pre>
<br/>
Sname is the name of the channel. This same name must be passed to
the channel() identifier in the corresponding &lt;Cabbage&gt;
section. Cabbage only works with the chnget/chnset method of
sending and receiving channel data. The invalue and outvalue
opcodes are not supported.<br/>
<br/>
The previous example can be modified so that a slider now controls
the volume of our oscillator.<br/>
<br/>
<pre>&lt;Cabbage&gt;
form size(400, 170), caption("Simple Synth"), pluginID("plu1")
hslider  bounds(0, 110, 380, 50), channel("gain"), range(0, 1, .5), textBox(1)
keyboard bounds(0, 0, 380, 100)
&lt;/Cabbage&gt;
&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
&lt;CsOptions&gt;
-n -d -+rtmidi=NULL -M0 --midi-key-cps=4 --midi-velocity-amp=5
&lt;/CsOptions&gt;
&lt;CsInstruments&gt;
sr = 44100
ksmps = 64
nchnls = 2
0dbfs=1

instr 1
k1 chnget "gain"
kenv linenr p5, 0.1, 1, 0.1
a1 oscil kenv*k1, p4, 1
outs a1, a1
endin

&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;
&lt;CsScore&gt;
f1 0 1024 10 1
f0 3600
&lt;/CsScore&gt;
&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;</pre>
<div><div class="group_img"><div class="image"><img src="static/simplesynth_1.PNG" height="127" width="253" alt=""/></div></div><br/></div>
<br/>
In the example above we use a <a href="http://www.thecabbagefoundation.org/documentation.php#x35" target="" title="">hslider</a> control which is a horizontal slider. The
bounds() identifier sets up the position and size of the widget.
The most important identifier is channel(). It is passed a string
"gain". This is the same string we pass to <a href="http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/chnget.html" target="" title="">chnget</a> in our Csound code. When a user moves the slider, the
current position of the slider is sent to Csound on a channel named
"gain". Without the channel() identifier no communication would
take place between the Cabbage control and Csound. The keyboard
widget can be used en lieu of a real MIDI keyboard when testing
plugins. It is also possible to move Cabbage widgets from within
the Csound orchestra using the <a href="http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/chnset.html" target="" title="">chnset</a> opcode.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>A basic Cabbage effect</h3>
<br/>
Cabbage effects are used to process incoming audio. To do so one
must make sure they can access the incoming audio stream. Any of
Csound's signal input opcodes can be used for this. The examples
that come with Cabbage use both the ins and inch opcodes to
retrieve the incoming audio signal. The following code is for a
simple reverb unit. It accepts a stereo input and outputs a stereo
signal.<br/>
<br/>
<pre>&lt;Cabbage&gt;
form caption("Reverb") size(230, 130)
groupbox text("Stereo Reverb"), bounds(0, 0, 200, 100)
rslider channel("size"), bounds(10, 25, 70, 70), text("Size"), range(0, 2, 0.2)
rslider channel("fco"), bounds(70, 25, 70, 70), text("Cut-off"), range(0, 22000, 10000)
rslider channel("gain"), bounds(130, 25, 70, 70), text("Gain"), range(0, 1, 0.5)
&lt;/Cabbage&gt;
&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
&lt;CsOptions&gt;
-d -n
&lt;/CsOptions&gt;
&lt;CsInstruments&gt;
; Initialize the global variables.
sr = 44100
ksmps = 32
nchnls = 2

instr 1
kfdback chnget "size"
kfco chnget "fco"
kgain chnget "gain"
ainL inch 1
ainR inch 2
aoutL, aoutR reverbsc ainL, ainR, kfdback, kfco
outs aoutL*kgain, aoutR*kgain
endin

&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;
&lt;CsScore&gt;
f1 0 4096 10 1
i1 0 1000
&lt;/CsScore&gt;
&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt; </pre>
<br/>
The above instrument uses 3 sliders to control the reverb size, the
cut-off frequency for the internal low-pass filters, and the
overall gain. The range() identifier is used with each slider to
specify the min, max and starting value of the sliders. If you
compare the two score sections in the above instruments you will
notice that the synth instrument does not use any i-statement.
Instead it uses an f0 3600. This tells Csound to wait for 3600
seconds before exiting. (In recent versions of Csound this
step is no longer necessary to sustain performance.) Because synth
instruments are controlled via MIDI we don’t need to use an
i-statement in the score. In the audio effect example we use an
i-statement with a long duration so that the effect runs without
stopping for a long time, typically longer than a user session in a
DAW. <br/>

<h2>Recent Innovations</h2>
<h3>gentable widget</h3>
<p>The gentable widget can be used to display any Csound function
table.</p>
<p/><div class="group_img"><div class="image"><img src="static/cabbagegentable.png" alt=""/></div></div><br/>
<p>gentable views can be updated during performance in order to
reflect any changes that may have been made to their contents by
the Csound orchestra. Updating is actuated by using the gentable
widget's so-called 'ident' channel (a channel that is used
exclusively for changing the appearance of widgets and that is
channel separate from the normal value channel).</p>
<p>It is also possible to modify the contents of a some function
tables that are represented using gentable by clicking and dragging
upon their GUI representations. This feature is a work in progress
and is currently only available with GEN 02, 05 and 07. </p>
<h3>soundfiler widget</h3>
<p>Whilst audio files stored in GEN 01 function tables
can be viewed using gentable it is more efficient (particularly
with longer files) to do this using the 'soundfiler' widget.</p>
<p/><div class="group_img"><div class="image"><img src="static/cabbagesoundfiler.png" alt=""/></div></div>
<p>soundfiler also facilitates zooming into and out of the viewed
waveform and a portion of the waveform can be highlighted using
click and drag. The start and end points of this highlighted region
can be read into Csound and used, for example, as loop points. An
example of this can be found in the Table3FilePlayer example in
Cabbage's built-in examples in the File Players subsection. A
'scrubber' (a vertical line through the waveform) can also be
displayed to indicate playback position.</p>
<p>Using soundfiler in combination with a button widget, we can
open a browser and browse for a new sound file during performance.
All of the examples in Examples&gt;FilePlayers make use of this
possibility.</p>
<h3>widgetarray</h3>
<p>The widgetarray identifier can be used with most widgets to
generate large numbers of widgets in a single step.</p>
<p/><div class="group_img"><div class="image"><img src="static/cabbagewidgetarray.png" alt=""/></div></div><br/>
<p>The screenshot from the example shown above (which can be found
in Cabbage's built-in examples in the 'FunAndGames' subsection)
employs 300 image widgets to create the stars and the UFO and these
are generated in a single line of code. Each individual widget can
be addressed from within the Csound orchestra using a numbered
identity channel, thereby they can be individually repositioned or
modified in any other way. This process can be simplified by using
looping procedures.</p>
<h3>texteditor</h3>
<p>The texteditor widget can be used to directly type in a string
on the computer keyboard which can then be sent to Csound. An
example use of this is to type in score events in real time
(exemplified in the example RealTimeScoreEvents in the the
'Instructional' subsection in Cabbage's built-in examples.)</p>
<h3>plants and popups </h3>
<p>Cabbage 'plants' provides a convenient mechanism with which GUI
elements which belong together in some way can be grouped. An
example of this might be the various widgets pertaining to the
values used by an envelope. Thereafter if becomes easier to modify
the grouped widgets en masse: to move them somewhere else in the
gui or to hide or reveal them completely.</p>
<p>An more elaborate function is to hold a plant in a completely
separate GUI window that can be launched using a 'pop-up' button.
An example of this is the 'Clavinet' instrument in the 'Synths'
subsection in Cabbage's built-in examples.</p>
<h3>Range sliders</h3>
<p>A special type of slider (horizontal or vertical but not rotary
'r' type) employs two control knobs so that it can output two
values.</p>
<p/><div class="group_img"><div class="image"><img src="static/cabbagerangeslider.png" alt=""/> </div></div>
<p>This widget can be seen in action in the example DelayGrain in
the 'Effects' subsection in Cabbage's built-in examples.</p>
<h3>Reserved Channels</h3>
<p>Reserved channels in Cabbage provide a means of reading in a
variety of data beyond that of the Cabbage GUI widgets. This
includes providing a means of reading in mouse position and mouse
button activations and also tempo, song position and
start/stop/record status (if used as a plugin within a host). These
channels are read using the chnset opcode. </p>
<p>More information on any of these features can be found in the
Cabbage reference manual which comes built into Cabbage or can be
found <a href="http://thecabbagefoundation.org/documentation.php" target="" title="">here</a>.  </p>
