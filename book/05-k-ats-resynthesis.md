# 05 K. ATS RESYNTHESIS

## The ATS Technique

### General overview

The _ATS_ technique (_Analysis-Transformation-Synthesis_) was developed
by Juan Pampin. A comprehensive explanation of this technique can be
found in his _ATS Theory_^[Juan Pampin, 2011,
[ATS_theory](https://dxarts.washington.edu/sites/dxarts/files/documents/wiki/ats_theory.pdf)]
but, essentially, it may be said that it
represents two aspects of the analyzed signal: the deterministic part
and the stochastic or residual part. This model was initially conceived
by Julius Orion Smith and Xavier Serra,^[Xavier Serra and Julius O. Smith III, 1990,
A Sound Analysis/Synthesis System Based on a Deterministic plus Stochastic Decomposition,
Computer Music Journal, Vol.14, 4, MIT Press, USA] but _ATS_ refines certain
aspects of it, such as the weighting of the spectral components on the
basis of their _Signal-to-Mask-Ratio (SMR)_.^[Eberhard Zwicker and Hugo Fastl,
1990, Psychoacoustics, Facts and Models. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg]

The deterministic part consists in sinusoidal trajectories with varying
amplitude, frequency and phase. It is achieved by means of the
depuration of the spectral data obtained using _STFT (Short-Time Fourier
Transform)_ analysis.

The stochastic part is also termed _residual_, because it is achieved by
subtracting the deterministic signal from the original signal. For such
purposes, the deterministic part is synthesized preserving the phase
alignment of its components in the second step of the analysis. The
residual part is represented with noise variable energy values along the
25 critical bands.^[Cf. Zwicker/Fastl (above footnote)]

The ATS technique has the following advantages:

1.  The splitting between deterministic and stochastic parts allows an
    independent treatment of two different qualitative aspects of an
    audio signal.
2.  The representation of the deterministic part by means of sinusoidal
    trajectories improves the information and presents it on a way that
    is much closer to the way that musicians think of sound. Therefore,
    it allows many _classical_ spectral transformations (such as the
    suppression of partials or their frequency warping) in a more
    flexible and conceptually clearer way.
3.  The representation of the residual part by means of noise values
    among the 25 critical bands simplifies the information and its
    further reconstruction. Namely, it is possible to overcome the
    common artifacts that arise in synthesis using oscillator banks or
    _IDFT_, when the time of a noisy signal analyzed using a FFT is
    warped.

### The ATS File Format

Instead of storing the _crude_ data of the FFT analysis, the ATS files
store a representation of a digital sound signal in terms of sinusoidal
trajectories (called _partials_) with instantaneous frequency,
amplitude, and phase changing along temporal frames. Each frame has a
set of partials, each having (at least) amplitude and frequency values
(phase information might be discarded from the analysis). Each frame
might also contain noise information, modeled as time-varying energy in
the 25 critical bands of the analysis residual. All the data is stored
as 64 bits floats in the host's byte order.

The ATS files start with a header at which their description is stored
(such as frame rate, duration, number of sinusoidal trajectories, etc.).
The header of the ATS files contains the following information:

1.  ats-magic-number (just the arbitrary number 123. for consistency
    checking)
2.  sampling-rate (samples/sec)
3.  frame-size (samples)
4.  window-size (samples)
5.  partials (number of partials)
6.  frames (number of frames)
7.  ampmax (max. amplitude)
8.  frqmax (max. frequency)
9.  dur (duration in sec.)
10. type (frame type, see below)

The ATS frame type may be, at present, one of the four following:

Type 1: only sinusoidal trajectories with amplitude and frequency data.
Type 2: only sinusoidal trajectories with amplitude, frequency and phase
data.
Type 3: sinusoidal trajectories with amplitude, and frequency data as
well as residual data.
Type 4: sinusoidal trajectories with amplitude, frequency and phase data
as well as residual data.

So, after the header, an ATS file with frame type 4, _np_ number of
partials and _nf_ frames will have:

    Frame 1:
        time tag
        Amp.of partial 1,   Freq. of partial 1, Phase of partial 1
        ..................................................................
        ..................................................................
        Amp.of partial np,   Freq. of partial np, Phase of partial np

        Residual energy  value for  critical band 1
        ..................................................................
        ..................................................................
        Residual energy  value for  critical band 25

    ......................................................................

    Frame nf:
        time tag
        Amp.of partial 1,   Freq. of partial 1, Phase of partial 1
        ..................................................................
        ..................................................................
        Amp.of partial np,   Freq. of partial np, Phase of partial np

        Residual energy  value for  critical band 1
        ..................................................................
        ..................................................................
        Residual energy  value for  critical band 25

As an example, an ATS file of frame type 4, with 100 frames and 10
partials will need:

- A header with 10 double floats values.
- 100 _ 10 _ 3 double floats for storing the Amplitude, Frequency and Phase
  values of 10 partials along 100 frames.
- 25 \* 100 double floats for storing the noise information of the 25
  critical bands along 100 frames.
- 100 double floats for storing the time tag information for each frame

        Header:                10 * 8     =       80 bytes
        Deterministic data:  3000 * 8     =    24000 bytes
        Residual data:       2500 * 8     =    20000 bytes
        Time tags data            100     =      800 bytes

        Total: 80 + 24000 + 20000 + 800   =    44880 bytes

The following Csound code shows how to retrieve the data of the header
of an ATS file.

## Performing ATS Analysis with the ATSA Command-line Utility of Csound

All the Csound Opcodes devoted to ATS Synthesis need to read an ATS
Analysis file. _ATS_ was initially developed for the _CLM_ environment
(_Common Lisp Music_), but at present there exist several _GNU_
applications that can perform _ATS_ analysis, among them the _Csound_
Package command-line utility _ATSA_ which is based on the _ATSA_ program
(Di Liscia, Pampin, Moss) and was ported to Csound by Istvan Varga.
The _ATSA_ program (Di Liscia, Pampin, Moss) may be obtained
at <https://github.com/jamezilla/ats/tree/master/ats>

### Graphical Resources for Displaying ATS Analysis Files

If a plot of the ATS files is required, the _ATSH_ software (Di Liscia,
Pampin, Moss) may be used. ATSH is a C program that uses the GTK graphic
environment. The source code and compilation directives can be obtained
at <https://github.com/jamezilla/ats/tree/master/ats>

Another very good GUI program that can be used for such purposes is
Qatsh, a Qt 4 port by Jean-Philippe Meuret.
This one can be obtained at <https://sourceforge.net/p/speed-dreams/code/HEAD/tree/subprojects/soundeditor/>

### Parameters Explanation and Proper Analysis Settings

The analysis parameters are somewhat numerous, and must be carefully
tuned in order to obtain good results. A detailed explanation of the
meaning of these parameters can be found at <https://csound.com/docs/manual/UtilityAtsa.html>

In order to get a good analysis, the sound to be analysed should meet
the following requirements:

1.  The ATS analysis was meant to analyse isolated, individual sounds.
    This means that the analysis of sequences and/or superpositions of
    sounds, though possible, is not likely to render optimal results.
2.  Must have been recorded with a good signal-to-noise ratio, and
    should not contain unwanted noises.
3.  Must have been recorded without reverberation and/or echoes.

A good ATS analysis should meet the following requirements:

1.  Must have a good temporal resolution of the frequency, amplitude,
    phase and noise (if any) data. The tradeoff between temporal and
    frequency resolution is a very well known issue in FFT based
    spectral analysis.
2.  The Deterministic and Stochastic (also termed \*residual) data
    must be reasonably separated in their respective ways of
    representation. This means that, if a sound has both, deterministic
    and stochastic data, the former must be represented by sinusoidal
    trajectories, whilst the latter must be represented by energy values
    among the 25 critical bands. This allows a more effective treatment
    of both types of data in the synthesis and transformation processes.
3.  If the analysed sound is pitched, the sinusoidal trajectories
    (Deterministic) should be as stable as possible and ordered
    according the original sound harmonics. This means that the first
    trajectory should represent the first (fundamental) harmonic,
    the second trajectory should represent the second harmonic, and so
    on. This allow to perform easily further transformation processes
    during resynthesis (such as, for example, selecting the odd
    harmonics to give them a different treatment than the others).

Whilst the first requirement is unavoidable, in order to get a useful
analysis, the second and third ones are sometimes almost impossible to
meet in full and their accomplishment depends often on the user
objectives.

## Synthesizing ATS Analysis Files

### Synthesis Techniques Applied to ATS.

The synthesis techniques that are usually applied in order to get a
synthesized sound that resembles the original sound as much as possible
are detailed explained in Pampin 2011^[Juan Pampin, 2011,
ATS_theory (see footnote 1)] and di Liscia 2013^[Oscar Pablo Di Liscia, 2013,
A Pure Data toolkit for real-time synthesis of ATS spectral data
<http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2013/papers/26.pdf>].
However, it is worth pointing out that once the proper data is stored in
an analysis file, the user is free to read and apply to this data any
reasonable transformation/synthesis technique/s, thereby facilitating
the creation of new and interesting sounds that need not be similar nor
resemble the original sound.

### Csound Opcodes for Reading ATS Data Files

The opcodes
[ATSread](https://csound.com/docs/manual/ATSread.html),
[ATSreadnz](https://csound.com/docs/manual/ATSreadnz.html),
[ATSbufread](https://csound.com/docs/manual/ATSbufread.html),
[ATSinterpread](https://csound.com/docs/manual/ATSinterpread.html) and
[ATSpartialtap](https://csound.com/docs/manual/ATSpartialtap.html)
were essentially developed to read ATS data from ATS files.

#### ATSread

This opcode reads the deterministic ATS data from an ATS file. It
outputs frequency/amplitude pairs of a sinusoidal trajectory
corresponding to a specific partial number, according to a time pointer
that must be delivered. As the unit works at _k-rate_, the frequency and
amplitude data must be interpolated in order to avoid unwanted clicks in
the resynthesis.

The following example reads and synthesizes the 10 partials of an ATS
analysis corresponding to a steady 440 cps flute sound. Since the
instrument is designed to synthesize only one partial of the ATS file,
the mixing of several of them must be obtained performing several notes
in the score (the use of Csound\'s macros is strongly recommended in
this case). Though not the most practical way of synthesizing ATS data,
this method facilitates individual control of the frequency and
amplitude values of each one of the partials, which is not possible any
other way. In the example that follows, even numbered partials are
attenuated in amplitude, resulting in a sound that resembles a clarinet.
Amplitude and frequency envelopes could also be used in order to affect
a time changing weighting of the partials. Finally, the amplitude and
frequency values could be used to drive other synthesis units, such as
filters or FM synthesis networks of oscillators.

#### ATSreadnz

This opcode is similar to _ATSread_ in the sense that it reads the noise
data of an ATS file, delivering k-rate energy values for the requested
critical band. In order to this Opcode to work, the input ATS file must
be either type 3 or 4 (types 1 and 2 do not contain noise data).
_ATSreadnz_ is simpler than _ATSread_, because whilst the number of
partials of an ATS file is variable, the noise data (if any) is stored
always as 25 values per analysis frame each value corresponding to the
energy of the noise in each one of the critical bands. The three
required arguments are: a time pointer, an ATS file name and the number
of critical band required (which, of course, must have a value between 1
and 25).

The following example is similar to the previous. The instrument is
designed to synthesize only one noise band of the ATS file, the mixing
of several of them must be obtained performing several notes in the
score. In this example the synthesis of the noise band is done using
Gaussian noise filtered with a resonator (i.e., band-pass) filter. This
is not the method used by the ATS synthesis Opcodes that will be further
shown, but its use in this example is meant to lay stress again on the
fact that the use of the ATS analysis data may be completely independent
of its generation. In this case, also, a macro that performs the
synthesis of the 25 critical bands was programmed. The ATS file used
correspond to a female speech sound that lasts for 3.633 seconds, and in
the examples is stretched to 10.899 seconds, that is three times its
original duration. This shows one of the advantages of the Deterministic
plus Stochastic data representation of ATS: the stochastic ("noisy")
part of a signal may be stretched in the resynthesis without the
artifacts that arise commonly when the same data is represented by
cosine components (as in the FFT based resynthesis). Note that, because
the Stochastic noise values correspond to energy (i.e., intensity), in
order to get the proper amplitude values, the square root of them must
be computed.

#### ATSbufread, ATSinterpread, ATSpartialtap.

The [ATSbufread](https://csound.com/docs/manual/ATSbufread.html) opcode
reads an ATS file and stores its frequency and amplitude data
into an internal table. The first and third input arguments are the same
as in the _ATSread_ and the _ATSreadnz_ Opcodes: a time pointer and an
ATS file name. The second input argument is a frequency scaler. The
fourth argument is the number of partials to be stored. Finally, this
Opcode may take two optional arguments: the first partial and the
increment of partials to be read, which default to 0 and 1 respectively.

Although this opcode does not have any output, the ATS frequency and
amplitude data is available to be used by other opcode. In this case,
two examples are provided, the first one uses the _ATSinterpread_ opcode
and the second one uses the _ATSpartialtap_ opcode.

The [ATSinterpread](https://csound.com/docs/manual/ATSinterpread.html)
opcode reads an ATS table generated by the _ATSbufread_ opcode and
outputs amplitude values interpolating them between the two amplitude
values of the two frequency trajectories that are closer to a given
frequency value. The only argument that this opcode takes is the desired
frequency value.

The following example synthesizes five sounds. All the data is taken
from the ATS file _test.ats_. The first and final sounds match the two
frequencies closer to the first and the second partials of the analysis
file and have their amplitude values closer to the ones in the original
ATS file. The other three sounds (second, third and fourth), have
frequencies that are in-between the ones of the first and second
partials of the ATS file, and their amplitudes are scaled by an
interpolation between the amplitudes of the first and second partials.
The more the frequency requested approaches the one of a partial, the
more the amplitude envelope rendered by ATSinterpread is similar to the
one of this partial. So, the example shows a gradual morphing beween
the amplitude envelope of the first partial to the amplitude envelope of
the second according to their frequency values.

The [ATSpartialtap](https://csound.com/docs/manual/ATSpartialtap.html)
opcode reads an ATS table generated by the _ATSbufread_ Opcode and
outputs the frequency and amplitude k-rate values of a specific partial
number. The example presented here uses four of these opcodes that read
from a single ATS buffer obtained using _ATSbufread_ in order to drive
the frequency and amplitude of four oscillators. This allows the mixing
of different combinations of partials, as shown by the three notes
triggered by the designed instrument.

### Synthesizing ATS data: ATSadd, ATSaddnz, ATSsinnoi. ATScross.

The four opcodes that will be presented in this section synthesize ATS
analysis data internally and allow for some modifications of these data
as well. A significant difference to the preceding opcodes is that the
synthesis method cannot be chosen by the user. The synthesis methods
used by all of these opcodes are fully explained in _Juan Pampin 2011_
and _Oscar Pablo Di Liscia 2013_ (see footnotes 1 and 6).

The [ATSadd](https://csound.com/docs/manual/ATSadd.html) opcode
synthesizes deterministic data from an ATS file using an array of table
lookup oscillators whose amplitude and frequency values are obtained by
linear interpolation of the ones in the ATS file according to the time
of the analysis requested by a time pointer.
The frequency of all the partials may be modified at k-rate,
allowing shifting and/or frequency modulation. An ATS file, a time
pointer and a function table are required. The table is supposed to
contain either a cosine or a sine function, but nothing prevents the
user from experimenting with other functions. Some care must be taken in
the last case, so as not to produce foldover (frequency aliasing). The
user may also request a number of partials smaller than the number of
partials of the ATS file (by means of the _inpars_ variable in the
example below). There are also two optional arguments: a partial offset
(i.e., the first partial that will be taken into account for the
synthesis, by means of the _ipofst_ variable in the example below) and
a step to select the partials (by means of the _inpincr_ variable in the
example below). Default values for these arguments are 0 and 1
respectively. Finally, the user may define a final optional argument
that references a function table that will be used to rescale the
amplitude values during the resynthesis. The amplitude values of all the
partials along all the frames are rescaled to the table length and used
as indexes to lookup a scaling amplitude value in the table. For
example, in a table of size 1024, the scaling amplitude of all the 0.5
amplitude values (-6 dBFS) that are found in the ATS file is in the
position 512 (1024/2). Very complex filtering effects can be obtained
by carefully setting these gating tables according to the amplitude
values of a particular ATS analysis.

The [ATSaddnz](https://csound.com/docs/manual/ATSaddnz.html) opcode
synthesizes residual ("noise") data from an ATS file using the method
explained above. This opcode works in a similar fashion to
_ATSadd_ except that frequency warping of the noise bands is not
permitted and the maximum number of noise bands will always be 25 (the
25 critical bands, see Zwicker/Fastl, footnote 3). The optional arguments
_offset_ and _increment_ work in a similar fashion to that in ATSadd.
The _ATSaddnz_ opcode allows the synthesis of several combinations of
noise bands, but individual amplitude scaling of them is not possible.

The [ATSsinnoi](https://csound.com/docs/manual/ATSsinnoi.html) opcode
synthesizes both deterministic and residual ("noise") data from an ATS file.
This opcode may be regarded as a combination of the two previous opcodes but with
the allowance of individual amplitude scaling of the mixes of
deterministic and residual parts. All the arguments of _ATSsinnoi_ are
the same as those for the two previous opcodes, except for the two
k-rate variables _ksinlev_ and _knoislev_ that allow individual, and
possibly time-changing, scaling of the deterministic and residual parts
of the synthesis.

[ATScross](https://csound.com/docs/manual/ATScross.html) is an
opcode that performs some kind of "interpolation" of the amplitude
data between two ATS analyses. One of these two ATS analyses must be
obtained using the _ATSbufread_ opcode (see above) and the other is to
be loaded by an _ATScross_ instance. Only the deterministic data of both
analyses is used. The ATS file, time pointer, frequency scaling, number
of partials, partial offset and partial increment arguments work the
same way as usages in previously described opcodes. Using the arguments
_kmylev_ and _kbuflev_ the user may define how much of the amplitude
values of the file read by _ATSbufread_ is to be used to scale the
amplitude values corresponding to the frequency values of the analysis
read by _ATScross_. So, a value of 0 for _kbuflev_ and 1 for _kmylev_
will retain the original ATS analysis read by _ATScross_ unchanged
whilst the converse (_kbuflev_ =1 and _kmylev_=0) will retain the
frequency values of the ATScross analysis but scaled by the amplitude
values of the _ATSbufread_ analysis. As the time pointers of both units
need not be the same, and frequency warping and number of partials may
also be changed, very complex cross synthesis and sound hybridation can
be obtained using this opcode.
