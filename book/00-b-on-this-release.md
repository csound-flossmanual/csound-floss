# ON THIS RELEASE

Csound 7 is finally out!

We have a stable Csound 7 beta since many months, and thanks to work by Hlöðver Sigurðsson and Steven Yi, we have now a Csound-WASM version of it, too. Hlöðver has applied this also to the Csound FLOSS Manual, so that we can use Csound 7 now here!

As a brief introduction to the exciting new features in Csound 7, I have added a [chapter](/basics/csound7) to the Appendix.

Enjoy!
