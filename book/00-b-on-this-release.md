# ON THIS RELEASE

After two and a half years, it is again time for a new major release.

Since the first release of this textbook in 2011 many things have changed.
With [csound.com](https://csound.com) we now have a good community website.
Links and informations about different ways to use Csound can go there.
We don't need them any more in the Csound FLOSS Manual, and it is better
to collect links and community information in one place.

It is also no longer necessary to provide information about the Frontends here.
All have own websites and introductions. No need to duplicate it here.

But what is really missing, in my opinion, is an up-to-date **Getting Started**.
So I decided to write it, and let the book begin with it.

It is followed by another new chapter. In this **How to ...** brief
descriptions provide instructions and advices for beginners and also
for more experienced Csound users. From _How to install Csound for Windows_
to _How to use my MIDI keyboard with Csound_ or _How to perform time stretch_.

For both chapters, I tried to insert as many links as possible, for both,
pointing to other chapters in this book, and pointing to external sources.

This re-ordering is a big work, and will probably never be finished.
This release is somehow a mix between old and new:

- The BASICS chapter has been moved from chapter 1 to chapter 16.
- The GET STARTED chapter has been removed. Its content is covered in chapter 1 and 2.
- The chapters about the frontends are not removed although they are not up to date.

Previous releases can be found at [https://github.com/csound-flossmanual/csound-flossmanual.github.io](https://github.com/csound-flossmanual/csound-flossmanual.github.io), as well as the current csd files and audio samples.

Big thanks goes to Hlöðver Sigurðsson who made this new interactive FLOSS manual
possible with all his great and important work on JavaScript-based Csound and much more.
