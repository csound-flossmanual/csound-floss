# ON THIS RELEASE

Csound 7 is finally out!

We have a stable Csound 7 beta since many months, and thanks to work by Hlöðver Sigurðsson and Steven Yi, we have now a [Csound-WASM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@csound/browser) version of it, too. Hlöðver has applied this also to the Csound FLOSS Manual, so that we can use Csound 7 now here!

As a brief introduction to the exciting new features in Csound 7, I have added a [chapter](/basics/csound7) to the Appendix.

As another good news: Xavier Dole has translated the *Getting Started* to French. It is available at [https://flossmanual.csound.com/fr](/fr), and other parts may be added in future. Other translations are welcome!

Enjoy and thanks in advance for any feedback which is really helpful to improve this book!
