# ON THIS RELEASE

After two and a half years, it is again time for a new major release.

Since the first release of this textbook in 2011 many things have changed.
With [csound.com](https://csound.com) we now have a good community website.
Links and informations about different ways to use Csound can go there.
We don't need them any more in the Csound Floss Manual, and it is better
to collect links and community information in only one place.

It is also no longer necessary to provide information about the frontends here.
All have own websites and introductions. All we do here is to link to them.

But what is really missing, in my opinion, is an up-to-date [**Getting Started**](/get-started).
So I decided to write it, and let the book begin with it.

It is followed by another new chapter. In this [**How to ...**](/how-to) I start to collect
brief descriptions which provide instructions and advices for beginners and also
for more experienced Csound users. From _How to install Csound for Windows_
to _How to use my MIDI keyboard with Csound_ or _How to perform time stretch_.

This re-ordering is a big work, and will probably never be finished.
This release is somehow a mix between old and new:

- New GETTING STARTED is now chapter 01, but only 10 of planned 24 tutorials are there.
- New HOW TO ... is now chapter 02, but only few of the desired decriptions are already there.
- The BASICS chapter has been moved from chapter 01 to chapter 16.
- The old GET STARTED (formerly chapter 01) has been removed.
  Its content is covered in the new GETTING STARTED for the introduction and the
  HOW TO ... for the installation guide.
- The old chapters about the frontends are not yet removed although they are not up to date.
  Once the HOW TO ... descriptions are more extended, they will be removed.
- Similar for some old content which might be outdated but still useful for some.
- To end with some new in old: The OSC chapter has been extended by some
  [practical examples](/other-communication/open-sound-control#practical-examples-with-processing)
  about the communication between Csound and Processing.

Big thanks goes to Hlöðver Sigurðsson who made this new interactive FLOSS manual
possible with all his great and important work on JavaScript-based Csound and much more.
