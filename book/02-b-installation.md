# HOW TO: INSTALLATION

## Csound and Frontends

### Can I install Csound without a Frontend?

Csound is an "audio engine" or "audio library".
You can install this plain Csound, and usually exactly this will happen if
you click on "install Csound".
But as a ordinary Csound user, and in particular as a beginner, you will not
only this "invisible" Csound.

### For which Jobs do I need a Frontend?

A frontend, or IDE (Intengrated Development Environment) will **run** Csound.
Usually you have a button to **start** and a button to **stop** a Csound
performance.

A frontend will provide an **editor** in which you can open, modify and save
**_.csd_ files**.

In addition to these essentials, the existing frontends offer different other
features, depending on their orientation.

### Which Frontends are available?

[CsoundQt](http://csoundqt.github.io) has been written in 2008 by Andrés Cabrera
to offer a multi-purpose frontend for basic usage of Csound. It is now maintained
by Tarmo Johannes and Eduado Moguillansky.

[Cabbage](https://cabbageaudio.com) has been developed since 2007 by Rory Walsh.
Its main focus is to export plugins from a Csound file to run in a DAW. Cabbage
has grown a lot and is currently the most popular way to work with Csound.

[Blue](https://blue.kunstmusik.com/) has been developed since 2004 by Steven Yi.
Its main focus is to provide an object-oriented way to work with the Csound
score. Around this, many features were added.

[Web IDE](https://ide.csound.com/) is an online IDE which has been started in
2018. Nothing to install here — just create an account and use Csound in your
browser.

### Which Frontend should I choose?

This depends on your needs, and what you like.
All possibilities are good for learning Csound.
