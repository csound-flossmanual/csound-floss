# 06 Hello Decibel

### What you learn in this tutorial

- How **human perception follows ratios** in both, frequencies and amplitudes.
- How the **Decibel (dB)** scale works.
- How to **convert Decibel values to amplitudes**.
- How to **use an expression as input argument** without creating a variable.

## Problems of Using Raw Amplitudes

In the last tutorial, we discussed some issues in working with raw frequencies,
and that it is usually preferred to work with MIDI note numbers.

There is a similar issue in working with raw amplitude values. Human perception
of both, pitch and volume, follows _ratios_. We hear the frequencies in the left
column as octaves because they all have the ratio 2 over 1:

    Frequency         Ratio
     8000 Hz
             > 8000 Hz / 4000 Hz = 2:1
     4000 Hz
             > 4000 Hz / 2000 Hz = 2:1
     2000 Hz
             > 2000 Hz / 1000 Hz = 2:1
     1000 Hz
             > 1000 Hz / 500 Hz = 2:1
      500 Hz
             > 500 Hz / 250 Hz = 2:1
      250 Hz
             > 250 Hz / 125 Hz = 2:1
      125 Hz

In the same way, we perceive these amplitudes as having equal loss in volume,
because they all follow the same ratio:

    Amplitude     Ratio
        1
             >  1 / 0.5 = 2
       0.5
             >  0.5 / 0.25 = 2
       0.25
             >  0.25 / 0.125 = 2
       0.125
             >  0.125 / 0.0625 = 2
       0.0625

As you see, already after four "intensity octaves" we get to an amplitude
smaller than 0.1. But human hearing is capable of about fifteen of these
intensity octaves!

## Decibel

It is the **Decibel** (dB) scale which reflects this. As you already know from
[Tutorial 2](01-GS-02.md), we set the amplitude 1 as reference value to
zero dB by this statement in the orchestra header:

    0dbfs = 1

Zero dB means here: The highest possible amplitude. Each amplitude ratio of
one over two is then a loss of about 6 dB. This yields the following relations
between amplitudes and decibels:

    Amplitude    dB
    1             0
    0.5          -6
    0.25        -12
    0.125       -18
    0.063       -24
    0.0316      -30
    0.01585     -36
    0.00794     -42
    0.00398     -48
    0.001995    -54
    0.001       -60

Note 1: To be precise, for an amplitude ratio of 1/2 the difference is
-6.0206 dB rather than -6 dB. So the amplitude column is not following precisely
the ratio 1/2.

Note 2: You can find more about sound intensities
[here](16-c-intensities.md) in this book.

Note 3: For the general context you may have a look at the
[Weber-Fechner law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber%E2%80%93Fechner_law).

## The 'ampdb' Opcode

So we will usually like to work with Decibel rather than with raw amplitudes.
As the oscillator requires an amplitude as input argument, we must **convert
decibel to amplitudes**. This is done via the `ampdb` (amplitude from decibel)
opcode. Run this, and have a look at the console output:

```csound
<CsoundSynthesizer>
<CsOptions>
-o dac
</CsOptions>
<CsInstruments>

sr = 44100
ksmps = 64
nchnls = 2
0dbfs = 1

instr Convert
  iAmp = ampdb:i(-6)
  print(iAmp)
endin

</CsInstruments>
<CsScore>
i "Convert" 0 0
</CsScore>
</CsoundSynthesizer>
```

You should see this message:

    instr 1:  iAmp = 0.501

Similar to `mtof`, the `ampdb` opcode can run at _i-rate_ or at _k-rate_.
Here we use _i-rate_, so `ampdb:i` because we have a number as input, and
not a signal.

We will use `ampdb:k` when we have time varying decibel values as input.
In the most simple case, it is a linear rise or decay. We can
create this input signal as usual with the `linseg` opcode.
Here is a signal which moves from -10 dB to -20 dB in half a second:

    kDb = linseg:k(-10,0.5,-20)

And this is the following conversion to amplitudes:

    kAmp = ampdb:k(kDb)

## Inserting an Expression as Input Argument

So far we have always stored the output of an opcode in a variable; The output
of an opcode gets a name, and this name is then used as input for the next
opcode in the chain. We have currently four chain links. These chain links are
written as numbers right hand side in the next figure.

![Input-output-chain with variables](../resources/images/01-GS-06-a.png)

It is possible to omit the variable names and to directly pass one expression
as input argument into the next chain link. This is the code to skip the variable
names for chain link 2:

    aSine = poscil:a(ampdb:k(kDb),mtof:k(kMidi))

And the figure can be drawn like this:

![Direct connection at chain link 2](../resources/images/01-GS-06-b.png)

## Example

This version is used in the example code.

```csound
<CsoundSynthesizer>
<CsOptions>
-o dac
</CsOptions>
<CsInstruments>

sr = 44100
ksmps = 64
nchnls = 2
0dbfs = 1

instr Hello
  kDb = linseg:k(-10,0.5,-20)
  kMidi = linseg:k(72,0.5,68)
  aSine = poscil:a(ampdb:k(kDb),mtof:k(kMidi))
  aOut = linen:a(aSine,0,p3,1)
  outall(aOut)
endin

</CsInstruments>
<CsScore>
i "Hello" 0 2
</CsScore>
</CsoundSynthesizer>
```

## Short or readable?

The possibility of directly inserting the output of one opcode in another
is potenially endless. It leads to shorter code.

On the other hand, if many of these expressions are put inside each other,
the code can become a stony desert of `(`, `:`, `,` and `))`.

Variables are actually not a necessary evil. If they carry a meaningful name,
they help reading what happens in the code: _kMidi_, _aSine_, ...

This is the beginning of the code in case we insert all four chain links in
each other:

    outall(linen:a(poscil:a(ampdb:k(linseg:k(-10,.5,-20),...)

But fortunately we have a limitation in the Csound FLOSS Manual: No code line
can be longer than 78 characters. Thanks to Hlöðver for it ...

In my opinion, the most valuable quality is the readability. But of course,
it is also a matter of personal taste, and a beginner needs probably more
steps than an experienced Csound coder. Make your choice, but be as clear as
possible in your code.

## Try it yourself

- Change the code so that you create the variable names _kAmp_ and _kFreq_
  first, as shown in the first figure. (You will get two more lines of code.)
- Play with omitting the variable names also in chain link 1, 3 or 4. Which
  version do you like most?

## Opcodes you have learned in this tutorial

- `ampdb:i(iDecibel)` converts a Decibel number to an amplitude number
- `ampdb:k(kDecibel)` converts a Decibal signal to an amplitude signal

### A big difference between dB and MIDI ...

We have stressed some similarities between working with pitch and with volumes.
The similarities derive from the fact that we perceive in a proportional way.
Both, the MIDI scale for pitch and the Decibel scale for volume, reflect this.

But there is one big difference between both. The MIDI scale is an **absolute**
scale. MIDI note number 69 is 440 Hz.

But the Decibel scale is a **relative** scale. It does not mean anything to
say "this is -6 dB" unless we have **set** something as **0 dB**.

### What is 0 dB?

In **acoustics**, 0 dB is set to a very small value. To put it in a non-scientific
way: The softest sound which we can hear.

This means that all common Decibel values are then **positive**, because they are
(much) more than this minimum. For instance around 60 dB for a normal conversation.

But as explained above, in **digital audio** it is the other way round.
Here our 0 dB setting is at the **maximum**, at the highest possible amplitude.

In digital audio, we have a certain number of bits for each sample: 16 bit, 24
bit, 32 bit. Whatever it be, there is a maximum. Imagine a 16 bit digital number
in which each bit can either be 0 or 1. The maximum possible amplitude is
when all bits are 1.

And so for the other resolutions. (They do not add something on top. They offer
a finer resolution between the maximum and the minimum.)

So it makes perfect sense to set this maximum possible amplitude as 0 dB.
But this means that in digital audio we only have **negative** dB values.

### Can I use positive dB values?

There is one exception. Yes it is true that there can be no amplitude larger
than 0 dB. But we can use positive dB in digital audio when we **amplify**
soft sounds.

As we saw in [Tutorial 04](/get-started/GS-04#volume-change-as-multiplication),
to amplify a signal means to multiply it by a value larger than 1. It makes
perfect sense to express this in decibel rather than in a multiplier.

We can say: "I amplify this signal by 6 dB", rather than: "I amplify it by
factor 2." And: "I amplify this signal by 12 dB" should be better than "I
amplify it by factor 4".

In this context we will use a positive number in a `ampdb` opcode. Here is a
simple example:

```csound
<CsoundSynthesizer>
<CsOptions>
-o dac
</CsOptions>
<CsInstruments>

sr = 44100
ksmps = 64
nchnls = 2
0dbfs = 1

instr Amplify
  //get dB value from fourth score parameter
  iDb = p4
  //create a very soft pink noise
  aNoise = pinkish(0.01)
  //amplify
  aOut = aNoise * ampdb(iDb)
  outall(aOut)
endin

</CsInstruments>
<CsScore>
i "Amplify" 0 2 0  //soft sound as it is
i "Amplify" 2 2 10 //amplification by 10 dB
i "Amplify" 4 2 20 //amplification by 20 dB
</CsScore>
</CsoundSynthesizer>
```
