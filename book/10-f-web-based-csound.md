# 10 F. WEB BASED CSOUND

Csound to be used in a browser via javascript is currently one of the most exciting developments. This chapter will be rewritten soon. For now, have a look at these introductions and tutorials:

1. Victor Lazzarini has written an extensive tutorial as [Vanilla Guide to Webaudio Csound](https://vlazzarini.github.io/vanilla/)
2. Steven Yi and Hlöðver Sigurðsson showed an extended tutorial on the ICSC 2022: [Csound on the Web](https://kunstmusik.github.io/icsc2022-csound-web)
3. Rory Walsh has contributed a tutorial about his [p5.csound](https://github.com/rorywalsh/p5.Csound), a wrapper to use Csound inside [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) sketches (the javascript version of [Processing](https://processing.org/): [https://rorywalsh.github.io/p5.Csound/#/](https://rorywalsh.github.io/p5.Csound/#/).

The WebAudio Csound Documentation can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@csound/browser).
