# 11 B. FILE INFO AND CONVERSION

## sndinfo

The utility _sndinfo_ (sound information) provides the user with some information about one or more sound files. _sndinfo_ is invoked and provided with a file name:

    sndinfo ../SourceMaterials/fox.wav

If you are unsure of the file address of your sound file you can always
just drag and drop it into the terminal window. The output should be
something like:

    util sndinfo:
    ../SourceMaterials/fox.wav:
        srate 44100, monaural, 16 bit WAV, 2.757 seconds
        (121569 sample frames)

_sndinfo_ will accept a list of file names and provide information on
all of them in one go so it may prove more efficient gleaning the same
information from a GUI based sample editor. We also have the advantage
of being able to copy and paste from the terminal window into a .csd
file.

## File Conversion Utilities

### het_import / het_export

The utilities
[het_import](https://csound.com/docs/manual/het_import.html) and
[het_export](https://csound.com/docs/manual/het_export.html)
are marked as deprecated because the files generated by
[hetro](https://csound.com/docs/manual/hetro.html) are text files nowadays.

### pvlook

The [pvlook](https://csound.com/docs/manual/pvlook.html) utility shows the output of a STFT analysis files created with [pvanal](https://csound.com/docs/manual/pvanal.html). The invocation is:

    pvlook [flags] infilename

As these files contain a big amount of information, the _flags_ contain some options to select a range of bins and frames:

- _-bb_ and _-eb_ set the begin and end of the bin number for the output (defaulting to lowest and highest bin)
- _-bf_ and _-ef_ set the begin and end of the analysis frames to be printed (defaulting to first and last frame).

If we want to look at the fifth bin only in the frames 100-110 or the file \*fox.pvx", we run:

    pvlook -bb 5 -eb 5 -bf 100 -ef 110 fox.pvx

The output is:

```
util pvlook:
; File name	/home/me/csound-manual-git/examples/fox.pvx
; Channels	1
; Word Format	float
; Frame Type	Amplitude/Frequency
; Source format	16bit
; Window Type	Kaiser(0.000000)
; FFT Size	1024
; Window length	2048
; Overlap	256
; Frame align	4104
; Analysis Rate	172.265625
; First Bin Shown: 5
; Number of Bins Shown: 1
; First Frame Shown: 100
; Number of Data Frames Shown: 11

Bin 5 Freqs.
 131.728 134.213 135.257 133.603 133.640 131.737 135.581 147.809 176.199
 211.347 149.678

Bin 5 Amps.

```

### pvexport / pvimport

Another method of transforming a .pvx analysis file created by  
[pvanal](https://csound.com/docs/manual/pvanal.html) is done with the
[pv_export](https://csound.com/docs/manual/pv_export.html) utility. It converts the binary file to a text file. After some general information about the source file in the header, each line contains amp-freq pairs of the bins.

The text file can be re-converted to a binary .pvx file with the
[pv_import](https://csound.com/docs/manual/pv_import.html) utility.

### sdif2ad

The [hetro](https://csound.com/docs/manual/hetro.html) utility will create an [sdif](http://cnmat.org/SDIF/) file if the extension _.sdif_ is given for the outfile. This file can be converted by the
[sdif2ad](https://csound.com/docs/manual/sdif2ad.html) utility to a file which can be used by the [adsyn](https://csound.com/docs/manual/adsyn.html) opcode.

### src_conv

Sample rate conversion is an everyday's situation in electronic music production. The
[src_conv](https://csound.com/docs/manual/src_conv.html)
utility is based on Eric de Castro Lopo's
[libsamplerate](https://github.com/erikd/libsamplerate). It offers five quality levels where 1 is the worst and 5 the best. The general syntax is here:

    src_conv [flags] infile

The most important flags are:

- **Q** conversion quality (1-5, default=3)
- **-o** name of the output file (default is _test.wav_)
- **-r** output sample rate
- **-s** or **-3** or **-f** output bit depth (16 (=default) / 24 / 32 bit)
- **-W** for _.wav_ as output format (other options are _-A_ = aiff and _-J_ = ircam)

To convert the sample rate of _fox.wav_ in best quality to 48 kHz and writing a 32 bit output file as _best_fox.wav_ we write:

```
src_conv -r 48000 -o best_fox.wav -W -Q5 -f fox.wav
```
