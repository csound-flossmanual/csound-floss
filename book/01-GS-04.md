# 04 Hello Fade-out


### What you learn in this tutorial

- How to apply **linear fades** to an instrument.
- What **p-fields** are. 
- What **p3** in an instrument means.


## Fade-in and Fade-out

Currently we have a rude end of the tone which is created by our instrument.
This is due to a brutal cutoff at the end of the instrument duration.

Imagine a sine wave which is cut anywhere. Perhaps this will happen:

![Click at the end of a sine wave](../resources/images/01-GS-04-a.png)

In this case we will hear a "click" at the end.

But even without this click: Usually we will prefer a soft end, similar to
how natural tones end.

The Csound opcode `linen` is very useful for applying simple fades to an audio signal.


## The 'linen' Opcode

The envelope which is created by `linen` looks like this:

"[The linen opcode]
(01-GS-04-b.png)"

We need three numbers to adjust the fades in `linen`:  
(1) The time to fade in.  
(2) The overall duration.  
(3) The time to fade out.


## The Score Parameter Fields

Usually we want to set `linen`'s overall duration to the note's duration.

For instance, if the note's duration is 2 seconds, we will want 2 seconds for 
`linen`'s overall duration.  
If the note's duration is 3 seconds, we will want 3 seconds for 
`linen`'s overall duration.  

In [Tutorial 01](/get-started/GS-01#the-csound-score), you have learned how 
the instrument duration is set in Csound.

You will remember that this is written in the score:

    i "Hello" 0 2

After the starting `i` which indicates an "instrument event", we have three 
values:  
1. The name of the instrument  
2. The start time  
3. The duration

We call these values **parameter fields**, or **p-fields**.

We have three p-fields in our score, abbreviated as **p1**, **p2** and **p3**.

"[Score parameter fields]
(01-GS-04-c.png)"



## 'p3' in an Instrument

A Csound instrument is instatiated via a score line.

Each score line has at least three parameter fields.

These parameters are passed to the instrument when it is instantiated.

So each instrument "knows" its __p1__ (its number or name), its __p2__ (its
start time), and its __p3__ (its duration).

And more:

Each instrument can **refer** to its score parameter fields by just writing
**p1** or **p2** or **p3** in the code.



## Example

In addition to the three input arguments for `linen` which we have discussed
above, we have as first input argument the audio signal which we want to modify.

This is the order of the four input arguments for the `linen` opcode:  
1. The audio signal to which the fade-in and fade-out is applied.  
2. The fade-in duration (in seconds).  
3. The overall duration for `linen`.  
4. The fade-out duration.

Look at the code.  Can you see how the code uses **p3** to adapt the duration
of `linen` to the duration of the instrument?

  kFreq = linseg:k(500,0.5,400)
  aSine = poscil:a(kAmp,kFreq)
  aOut = linen:a(aSine,0,p3,1)
  outall(aOut)
endin

## Volume Change as Multiplication

How can we apply the signal which we have plotted above, moving as 
fade-in from 0 to 1, and as fade-out from 1 to 0, to an audio signal?

This is done by multiplication.

We multiply the audio signal with the envelpe signal which `linen` generates.

    aEnv = linen:a(1,0.5,p3,0.5)
    aSine = poscil:a(0.2,400)
    aOut = aEnv * aSine

ABBILDUNG?

Actually, the form

    aOut = linen:a(aSine,0.5,p3,0.5)

is a shortcut for this multiplication.



## Try it yourself

Change the code so that 

- You add a fade-in of 0.5 seconds. (Currently we only have a fade-out.)
- You make the instrument play for 5 seconds, instead of 2 seconds.
- You apply a fade-out for the whole duration of the instrument, regardless
what this duration be.
- You apply a fade-in of 1 second, but no fade-out.
- You apply a fade-in of half the instrument's duration, and a fade-out of 
also half the instrument's duration. (This will result in a triangular 
envelope shape.)
- You insert **p3** in the *kAmp* line so that the amplitude changes over
the whole duration of the instrument.
- You insert **p3** in the *kFreq* line so that the frequency changes over
the whole duration of the instrument.



## Opcodes and symbols you have learned in this tutorial

### Opcodes

- `linen:a(aIn,Fade-in,Duration,Fade-out)` linear fade-in and fade-out 

### Symbols

- `p1` the first parameter of the score line which calls the instrument: 
number or name of the instrument
- `p2` the second parameter of the score line which calls the instrument: 
the start time of the instrument 
- `p3` the third parameter of the score line which calls the instrument: 
the duration of the instrument

Note: `p3` refers to the score, but inside the score it has no meaning,
and Csound will throw an error if you write **p3** as symbol in the score.  
It only has a meaning in the **instrument** code.

### 'linen's amplitude input

The first input for `linen` is the amplitude.

In the most simple case this amplitude is a fixed number. 
If it is 1, then we have the basic shape which we saw at the beginning of
this chapter:

SCHEMA / ZEICHNUNG

The `linen` opcode will then perform a fade-in from 0 to 1, and a fade-out
from 1 to 0.

In the example, we have used the `linen` opcode in directly inserting an audio
signal in its first input.  

SCHEMA / ZEICHNUNG

As the first input of `linen` is an amplitude, it can be a constant
amplitude, or a signal.

As you already know, in a signal the amplitude values change over time,
either at *k-rate* or at *a-rate*.



### Should we not use a k-rate opcode for fades?

Perhaps you wonder why we created an audio signal for the envelope signal.  
Would it not be more efficient to use a control signal for the envelope?  
The code would then read:

    kFade = linen:k(1,0.5,p3,0.5)
    aSine = poscil:a(0.2,400)
    aOut = kFade * aSine

Indeed this is slightly more efficient. But for modern computers, this is a
neglectable performance gain.

On the other hand, a-rate envelopes are preferable because they are really 
smooth. They have no "staircases" as k-rate envelope have.

You can read more 
[here](http://localhost:3000/csound-language/initialization-and-performance-pass#possible-problems-with-k-rate-tick-size) 
about this subject. I personally recommend to always use a-rate envelopes.


### Is it good to have linear fades?

A linear fade is a fade which draws a line for the transition between 0 an 1, 
or the transition between 1 and 0.  

ABB: LINES VERSUS CURVES

This is where the name "linen" comes from: a linear envelope generator.

Acoustically these fades are not the best. We will discuss the reasons in
[Tutorial 06](01-GS-06.md).  

Practically, the linear fades which `linen` generates are sufficient for
many cases. But keep in mind that there are other possible shapes for fades,
and move to them when you are not satisfied how it sounds. The `transeg` opcode
will be your friend then.
