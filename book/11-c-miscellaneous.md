===================

A final group gathers together various unsorted utilities:
[cs](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/cs.html),
[csb64enc](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/csb64enc.html),
[envext](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/envext.html),
[extractor](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/extractor.html),
[makecsd](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/makecsd.html),
[mixer](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/mixer.html),
[scale](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/scaleutility.html) and
[mkdb](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/mkdb.html). Most interesting
of these are perhaps
[extractor](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/extractor.html) which
will extract a user defined fragment of a sound file which it will then
write to a new file,
[mixer](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/mixer.html) which mixes
together any number of sound files and with gain control over each file
and [scale](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/scaleutility.html) which
will scale the amplitude of an individual sound file.
