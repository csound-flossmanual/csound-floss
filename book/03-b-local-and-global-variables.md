# 03 B. LOCAL AND GLOBAL VARIABLES

## Variable Types

In Csound, there are several types of variables. It is important to
understand the differences between these types. There are

- **initialization** variables, which are updated at each
  initialization pass, i.e. at the beginning of each note or score
  event. They start with the character **i**. To this group count also
  the score parameter fields, which always starts with a **p**,
  followed by any number: _p1_ refers to the first parameter field in
  the score, _p2_ to the second one, and so on.
- **control** variables, which are updated at each control cycle
  during the performance of an instrument. They start with the
  character **k**.
- **audio** variables, which are also updated at each control cycle,
  but instead of a single number (like control variables) they consist
  of a vector (a collection of numbers), having in this way one number
  for each sample. They start with the character **a**.
- **string** variables, which are updated either at i-time or at
  k-time (depending on the opcode which produces a string). They start
  with the character **S**.

Except these four standard types, there are two other variable types
which are used for spectral processing:

- **f**-variables are used for the streaming phase vocoder opcodes
  (all starting with the characters **pvs**), which are very important
  for doing realtime FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) in Csound. They are
  updated at k-time, but their values depend also on the FFT
  parameters like frame size and overlap. Examples for using _f_-sigs
  can be found in chapter [05 I](05-i-fourier-analysis-spectral-processing.md).
- **w**-variables are used in some older spectral processing opcodes.

The following example exemplifies all the variable types (except the
w-type):

You can think of variables as named connectors between opcodes. You can
connect the output from an opcode to the input of another. The type of
connector (audio, control, etc.) is determined by the first letter of
its name.

For a more detailed discussion, see the article
[An overview Of Csound Variable Types](http://csoundjournal.com/issue10/CsoundRates.html)
by Andr√©s Cabrera in the
[Csound Journal](http://csoundjournal.com/index.html), and the
page about
[Types, Constants and Variables](https://csound.com/docs/manual/OrchKvar.html) in
the [Canonical Csound Manual](https://csound.com/docs/manual/index.html).

## Local Scope

The **scope** of these variables is usually the **instrument** in which
they are defined. They are **local** variables. In the following
example, the variables in instrument 1 and instrument 2 have the same
names, but different values.

#### **_EXAMPLE 03B02_Local_scope.csd_**

;S-variable updated at each control-cycle

  endin

          outs      aMyVar, aMyVar
;S-variable updated just at init-time

                i(kMyVar)

;S-variable updated at each control-cycle
SMyVar2 sprintfk "This string is updated at k-time: kMyVar = %d\n", kMyVar

This is the output (first the output at init-time by the print opcode,
then at each k-cycle the output of printk and the two printf opcodes):

    new alloc for instr 1:
    instr 1:  iMyVar = 1.000
     i   1 time     0.10000:     1.00000

    This string is updated at k-time: kMyVar = 102

    B  1.000 ..  1.300 T  1.300 TT  1.300 M:  0.29998  0.29998

## Global Scope

If you need variables which are recognized beyond the scope of an
instrument, you must define them as **global**. This is done by
prefixing the character **g** before the types i, k, a or S. See the
following example:

#### **_EXAMPLE 03B03_Global_scope.csd_**

```csound
<CsoundSynthesizer>
<CsInstruments>
sr = 44100
ksmps = 4410; very high because of printing
nchnls = 2
0dbfs = 1

 ;global scalar variables should be inititalized in the header
giMyVar   init      0
gkMyVar   init      0

  instr 1
 ;global i-variable
giMyVar   =         giMyVar + 1
          print     giMyVar
 ;global k-variable
gkMyVar   =         gkMyVar + 1
          printk    0, gkMyVar
 ;global S-variable updated just at init-time
gSMyVar1 sprintf "This string is updated just at init-time: gkMyVar = %d\n",
                 i(gkMyVar)
          printf    "%s", gkMyVar, gSMyVar1
 ;global S-variable updated at each control-cycle
gSMyVar2 sprintfk "This string is updated at k-time: gkMyVar = %d\n", gkMyVar
          printf    "%s", gkMyVar, gSMyVar2
  endin

  instr 2
 ;global i-variable, gets value from instr 1
giMyVar   =         giMyVar + 1
          print     giMyVar
 ;global k-variable, gets value from instr 1
gkMyVar   =         gkMyVar + 1
          printk    0, gkMyVar
 ;global S-variable updated just at init-time, gets value from instr 1
          printf    "Instr 1 tells: '%s'\n", gkMyVar, gSMyVar1
 ;global S-variable updated at each control-cycle, gets value from instr 1
          printf    "Instr 1 tells: '%s'\n\n", gkMyVar, gSMyVar2
  endin

</CsInstruments>
<CsScore>

i 2 0 .3
</CsScore>
</CsoundSynthesizer>
;example by joachim heintz
```

The output shows the global scope, as instrument 2 uses the values which
have been changed by instrument 1 in the same control cycle:

    new alloc for instr 1:
    instr 1:  giMyVar = 1.000
    new alloc for instr 2:
    instr 2:  giMyVar = 2.000
     i   1 time     0.10000:     1.00000
    This string is updated just at init-time: gkMyVar = 0
    This string is updated at k-time: gkMyVar = 1
     i   2 time     0.10000:     2.00000
    Instr 1 tells: 'This string is updated just at init-time: gkMyVar = 0'
    Instr 1 tells: 'This string is updated at k-time: gkMyVar = 1'
     i   1 time     0.20000:     3.00000
    This string is updated just at init-time: gkMyVar = 0
    This string is updated at k-time: gkMyVar = 3
     i   2 time     0.20000:     4.00000
    Instr 1 tells: 'This string is updated just at init-time: gkMyVar = 0'
    Instr 1 tells: 'This string is updated at k-time: gkMyVar = 3'
     i   1 time     0.30000:     5.00000
    This string is updated just at init-time: gkMyVar = 0
    This string is updated at k-time: gkMyVar = 5
     i   2 time     0.30000:     6.00000
    Instr 1 tells: 'This string is updated just at init-time: gkMyVar = 0'
    Instr 1 tells: 'This string is updated at k-time: gkMyVar = 5'

## How To Work With Global Audio Variables

Some special considerations must be taken if you work with global audio
variables. Actually, Csound behaves basically the same whether you work
with a local or a global audio variable. But usually you work with
global audio variables if you want to **add** several audio signals to a
global signal, and that makes a difference.

The next few examples are going into a bit more detail. If you just want
to see the result (= global audio usually must be cleared), you can skip
the next examples and just go to the last one of this section.

### Introductory Examples

It should be understood first that a global audio variable is treated
the same by Csound if it is applied like a local audio signal:

#### **_EXAMPLE 03B04_Global_audio_intro.csd_**

```csound
<CsoundSynthesizer>
<CsOptions>
-odac
</CsOptions>
<CsInstruments>
sr = 44100
ksmps = 32
nchnls = 2
0dbfs = 1

  instr 1; produces a 400 Hz sine
gaSig     oscils    .1, 400, 0
  endin

  instr 2; outputs gaSig
          outs      gaSig, gaSig
  endin

</CsInstruments>
<CsScore>
i 1 0 3
i 2 0 3
</CsScore>
</CsoundSynthesizer>
;example by joachim heintz
```

Of course there is no need to use a global variable in this case. If you
do it, you risk your audio will be overwritten by an instrument with a
higher number using the same variable name. In the following example,
you will just hear a 600 Hz sine tone, because the 400 Hz sine of
instrument 1 is overwritten by the 600 Hz sine of instrument 2:

#### **_EXAMPLE 03B05_Global_audio_overwritten.csd_**

```csound
<CsoundSynthesizer>
<CsOptions>
-o dac
</CsOptions>
<CsInstruments>
sr = 44100
ksmps = 32
nchnls = 2
0dbfs = 1

  instr 1; produces a 400 Hz sine
gaSig     oscils    .1, 400, 0
  endin

  instr 2; overwrites gaSig with 600 Hz sine
gaSig     oscils    .1, 600, 0
  endin

  instr 3; outputs gaSig
          outs      gaSig, gaSig
  endin

```

### Adding Global Variables

In general, you will use a global audio variable like a bus to which
several local audio signal can be **added**. It's this addition of a
global audio signal to its previous state which can cause some trouble.
Let's first see a simple example of a control signal to understand what
is happening:

#### **_EXAMPLE 03B06_Global_audio_added.csd_**

```csound
<CsoundSynthesizer>
<CsInstruments>
sr = 44100
ksmps = 4410; very high because of printing
nchnls = 2
0dbfs = 1

  instr 1
kSum      init      0; sum is zero at init pass
kAdd      =         1; control signal to add
kSum      =         kSum + kAdd; new sum in each k-cycle
          printk    0, kSum; print the sum
  endin

</CsInstruments>
<CsScore>
i 1 0 1
</CsScore>
</CsoundSynthesizer>
;example by joachim heintz
```

In this case, the \"sum bus\" kSum increases at each control cycle by 1,
because it adds the kAdd signal (which is always 1) in each k-pass to
its previous state. It is no different if this is done by a local
k-signal, like here, or by a global k-signal, like in the next example:

#### **_EXAMPLE 03B07_Global_control_added.csd_**

```csound
<CsoundSynthesizer>
<CsInstruments>
sr = 44100
ksmps = 4410; very high because of printing
nchnls = 2
0dbfs = 1

gkSum     init      0; sum is zero at init

  instr 1
gkAdd     =         1; control signal to add
  endin

  instr 2
gkSum     =         gkSum + gkAdd; new sum in each k-cycle
          printk    0, gkSum; print the sum
  endin

</CsInstruments>
<CsScore>
i 1 0 1
i 2 0 1
</CsScore>
</CsoundSynthesizer>
;example by joachim heintz
```

### Adding Audio Vectors

What happens when working with audio signals instead of control signals
in this way, repeatedly adding a signal to its previous state? Audio
signals in Csound are a collection of numbers (a vector). The size of
this vector is given by the ksmps constant. If your sample rate is
44100, and ksmps=100, you will calculate 441 times in one second a
vector which consists of 100 numbers, indicating the amplitude of each
sample.

So, if you add an audio signal to its previous state, different things
can happen, depending on the vector's present and previous states. If
both previous and present states (with ksmps=9) are
\[0 0.1 0.2 0.1 0 -0.1 -0.2 -0.1 0\]
you will get a signal which is twice as strong:
\[0 0.2 0.4 0.2 0 -0.2 -0.4 -0.2 0\]. But if the present state is opposite
\[0 -0.1 -0.2 -0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.1 0\], you will only get zeros when you
add them. This is shown in the next example with a local audio variable,
and then in the following example with a global audio variable.

#### **_EXAMPLE 03B08_Local_audio_add.csd_**

;example by joachim heintz
```

In both cases, you get a signal which increases each 1/10 second,
because you have 10 control cycles per second (ksmps=4410), and the
frequency of 400 Hz can be evenly divided by this. If you change the
ksmps value to 441, you will get a signal which increases much faster
and is out of range after 1/10 second. If you change the frequency to
401 Hz, you will get a signal which increases first, and then decreases,
because each audio vector has 40.1 cycles of the sine wave. So the
phases are shifting; first getting stronger and then weaker. If you
change the frequency to 10 Hz, and then to 15 Hz (at ksmps=44100), you
cannot hear anything, but if you render to file, you can see the whole
process of either enforcing or erasing quite clear:

![*<small>Self-reinforcing global audio signal on account of its state in one
control cycle being the same as in the previous one</small>*](../resources/images/03-b-add-freq10hz-1.png)

![*<small>Partly self-erasing global audio signal because of phase inversions in
two subsequent control cycles</small>*](../resources/images/03-b-add-freq15hz-1.png)

### Clear Global Audio After Adding

So the result of all is: If you work with global audio variables in a
way that you add several local audio signals to a global audio variable
(which works like a bus), you must **clear** this global bus at each
control cycle. As in Csound all the instruments are calculated in
ascending order, it should be done either at the beginning of
the **first**, or at the end of the **last** instrument. Perhaps it is the
best idea to declare all global audio variables in the orchestra header
first, and then clear them in an \"always on\" instrument with the
highest number of all the instruments used. This is an example of a
typical situation:

### The _chn_ Opcodes for Global Variables

Instead of using the traditional g-variables for any values or signals
which are to transfer between several instruments, many users prefer
to use the [chn](https://csound.com/docs/manual/chn.html) opcodes.
An i-, k-, a- or S-value or signal can be set
by [chnset](https://csound.com/docs/manual/chnset.html) and received
by [chnget](https://csound.com/docs/manual/chnget.html). One advantage
is to have strings as names, so that you can choose intuitive names.

For audio variables, instead of performing an addition, you can use
the [chnmix](https://csound.com/docs/manual/chnmix.html) opcode.
For clearing an audio variable,
the [chnclear](https://csound.com/docs/manual/chnclear.html) opcode
can be used.
