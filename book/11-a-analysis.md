# 11 A. ANALYSIS

Csound comes bundled with a variety of additional utility applications.
These are small programs that perform a single function, very often with
a sound file, that might be useful just before or just after working
with the main Csound program. Originally these were programs that were
run from the command line but many of Csound front-ends now offer direct
access to many of these utilities through their own utilities menus. It
is useful to still have access to these programs via the command line
though, if all else fails.

The standard syntax for using these programs from the command line is to
type the name of the utility followed optionally by one or more command
line flags which control various performance options of the program —
all of these will have useable defaults anyway — and finally the name of
the sound file upon which the utility will operate.

    utility_name [flag(s)] [file_name(s)]

If we require some help or information about a utility and don't want
to be bothered hunting through the Csound Manual we can just type the
the utility's name with no additional arguments, hit enter and the
commmand line response will give us some information about that utility
and what command line flags it offers. We can also run the utility
through Csound — perhaps useful if there are problems running the
utility directly — by calling Csound with the _-U_ flag. The _-U_ flag will
instruct Csound to run the utility and to interpret subsequent flags as
those of the utility and not its own.

    Csound -U utility_name [flag(s)] [file_name(s)]

## Analysis Utilities

Although many of Csound's opcodes already operate upon commonly
encountered sound file formats such as _wav_ and _aiff_, a number of
them require sound information in more specialised and pre-analysed
formats, and for this Csound provides the sound analysis utilities
[atsa](https://csound.com/docs/manual/UtilityAtsa.html),
[cvanal](https://csound.com/docs/manual/cvanal.html),
[hetro](https://csound.com/docs/manual/hetro.html),
[lpanal](https://csound.com/docs/manual/lpanal.html) and
[pvanal](https://csound.com/docs/manual/pvanal.html).

We will explain in the following paragraphs the background and usage of these five different sound analysis utilities.

### atsa

Chapter [05 K](05-k-ats-resynthesis.md) gives some background about
the _Analysis-Transformation-Synthesis_ (ATS) method of spectral resynthesis.
It requires the preceding analysis of a sound file. This is the job of the _atsa_ utility.

The basic usage is simple:

    atsa [flags] infilename outfilename

where _infilename_ is the sound file to be analyzed, and _outfilename_ is
the _.ats_ file which is written as result of the _atsa_ utility.

It can be said that the default values of the various _flags_ are reasonable for a first usage.
For a refinement of the analysis the [atsa manual page](https://csound.com/docs/manual/UtilityAtsa.html) provides
all necessary information.

### cvanal

The _cvanal_ utility analyses an impulse response for usage in
the old [concolve](https://csound.com/docs/manual/convolve.html) opcode.
Nowadays, convolution in Csound is mostly done with other opcodes which are described in
the [Convolution](05-h-convolution.md) chapter of this book.
More information about the _cvanal_ utility can be
found [here](https://csound.com/docs/manual/cvanal.html) in the Csound Manual.

### hetro

The hetrodyne filter analysis can be understood as one way of applying the Fourier Transform.^[Cf. Curtis Roads,
The Computer Music Tutorial, Cambridge MA: MIT Press 1996, 548-549;
James Beauchamp, Analysis, Synthesis and Perception of Musical Sounds, New York:Springer 2007, 5-12]
Its attempt is to reconstruct a number of partial tracks in a time-breakpoint manner. The breakpoints are measured in milliseconds.
Although this utility is originally designed for the usage in
the [adsyn](https://csound.com/docs/manual/adsyn.html) opcode,
it can be used to get data from any harmonic sound for additive synthesis.

The usage of _hetro_ follows the general utility standard:

    hetro [flags] infilename outfilename

But the adjustment of some _flags_ is crucial here depending on the desired usage of the analysis:

- **-f** _begfreq_: This is the estimated frequency of the fundamental.
  The default is 100 Hz, but it should be adjusted as good as possible to
  the real fundamental frequency of the input sound.
- **-h** _partials_: This is the number of partials the utility will analyze and write in the output file.
  The default number of 10 is quite low and will usually result in a dull sound in the resynthesis.
- **-n** _brkpts_: This is the number of breakpoints for the analysis.
  These breakpoints are initially evenly spread over the duration,
  and then reduced and adjusted by the algorithm.
  The default number of 256 is reasonable for most usage,
  but can be massively reduced for some sounds and usages.
- **-m** _minamp_: The _hetro_ utility uses the old Csound amplitude convention where 0 dB is set to 32767.
  This has to be considered in this option, in which a minimal amplitude is set.
  Below this amplitude a partial is considered dormant.
  So the default 64 corresponds to -54 dB; other common values
  are 128 (-48 dB), 32 (-60 dB) or 0 (no thresholding).

As an example, we start the utility with these parameters:

This is the output of the analysis in the Csound console:

The file _BratscheMono.het_ starts with `HETRO 10` as first line,
showing that 10 partial track data will follow.
The amplitude data lines begin with -1, the frequency data lines begin with -2.
This is start and end of the first two lines, slightly formatted to show the breakpoints:

```
-1, 0,0,   815,3409, 1631,11614, 2447,12857, ... , 7343,0,   32767
-2, 0,220, 815,217,  1631,218,   2447,219, ...   , 7343,217, 32767
```

After the starting -1 or -2, the time-value pairs are written.
Here we have at 0 ms an amplitude of 0 and a frequency of 220.
At 815 ms we have amplitude of 3409 and frequency of 217.
At 7343 ms, near the end of this file, we have amplitude of 0 and frequency of 217,
followed in both cases by 32767 (as additional line ending signifier).

### lpanal

Linear Prediction Coding has been developed for the analysis and resynthesis of speech.^[Cf. Curtis Roads,
The Computer Music Tutorial, Cambridge MA: MIT Press 1996, 200-210]
The [lpanal](https://csound.com/docs/manual/lpanal.html) utility
performs the analysis, which will then be used by the
[LPC Resynthesis Opcodes](https://csound.com/docs/manual/SpectralLpcresyn.html).
The defaults can be seen in the following screenshot:

![LPANAL Utility in CsoundQt](../resources/images/11-a-lpanal.png)

It should be mentioned that in 2020 Victor Lazzarini wrote a bunch of
opcodes which apply real-time (streaming) linear prediction analysis.
The complement of the old lpanal utility is
the [lpcanal](https://csound.com/docs/manual/lpcanal.html) opcode.

### pvanal

The [pvanal](https://csound.com/docs/manual/pvanal.html) utility performs a
Short-Time Fourier Transform over a sound file.
It will produce a _.pvx_ file which can be used by the old _pv_-opcodes.
Nowadays the _pvs_-opcodes are mostly in use;
see chapter [05 I](05-i-fourier-analysis-spectral-processing.md) of this book.
Nevertheless, the _pvanal_ utility provides a simple option to perform
FFT and write the result in a file.

The main parameter are few; the defaults can be seen here:

![PVANAL Utility in CsoundQt](../resources/images/11-a-pvanal.png)

The binary data of a _.pvx_ file can be converted in a text file via
the [pvlook](https://csound.com/docs/manual/pvlook.html) utility.
