# 03 G. USER DEFINED OPCODES

Opcodes are the core units of everything that Csound does. They are like
little machines that do a job, and programming is akin to connecting
these little machines to perform a larger job. An opcode usually has
something which goes into it: the inputs or arguments, and usually it
has something which comes out of it: the output which is stored in one
or more variables. Opcodes are written in the programming language C
(that is where the name _Csound_ comes from). If you want to create a
new opcode in Csound, you must write it in C. How to do this is
described in the [Extending Csound](13-a-developing-plugin-opcodes.md)
chapter of this manual, and is also described in the relevant
[chapter](http://www.csound.com/docs/manual/csound5extending.html) of
the [Canonical Csound Reference Manual](http://www.csound.com/docs/manual/index.html).

There is, however, a way of writing your own opcodes in the Csound
Language itself. The opcodes which are written in this way, are called
_User Defined Opcodes_ or *UDO*s. A _UDO_ behaves in the same way as a
standard opcode: it has input arguments, and usually one or more output
variables. It runs at i-time or at k-time. You use them as part of the
Csound Language after you have defined and loaded them.

User Defined Opcodes have many valuable properties. They make your
instrument code clearer because they allow you to create abstractions
of blocks of code. Once a _UDO_ has been defined it can be recalled and
repeated many times within an orchestra, each repetition requiring only
a single line of code. *UDO*s allow you to build up your own library of
functions you need and return to frequently in your work. In this way,
you build your own Csound dialect within the Csound Language. *UDO*s also
represent a convenient format with which to share your work in Csound
with other users.

This chapter explains, initially with a very basic example, how you can
build your own *UDO*s, and what options they offer. Following this, the
practice of loading *UDO*s in your .csd file is shown, followed by some
tips in regard to some unique capabilities of *UDO*s.
Finally some examples are shown for
different User Defined Opcode definitions and applications.

If you want to write a User Defined Opcode in Csound6 which uses arrays,
have a look at the end of chapter [03E](03-e-arrays.md) to see their usage and naming
conventions.

## Transforming Csound Instrument Code to a User Defined Opcode

Writing a User Defined Opcode is actually very easy and straightforward.
It mainly means to extract a portion of usual Csound instrument code,
and put it in the frame of a UDO. Let us start with the instrument code:

#### **_EXAMPLE 03G01_Pre_UDO.csd_**

```csound
<CsoundSynthesizer>
<CsOptions>
-odac
</CsOptions>
<CsInstruments>
sr = 44100
ksmps = 32
nchnls = 2
0dbfs = 1

          seed      0

iFb = .7; feedback multiplier
aSnd rand .2; white noise
kdB randomi -18, -6, .4; random movement between -18 and -6
aSnd = aSnd * ampdb(kdB); applied as dB to noise
kFiltFq randomi 100, 1000, 1; random movement between 100 and 1000
aFilt reson aSnd, kFiltFq, kFiltFq/5; applied as filter center frequency
aFilt balance aFilt, aSnd; bring aFilt to the volume of aSnd
aDelTm randomi .1, .8, .2; random movement between .1 and .8 as delay time
aDel vdelayx aFilt + iFb*aDel, aDelTm, 1, 128; variable delay
kdbFilt randomi -12, 0, 1; two random movements between -12 and 0 (dB) ...
kdbDel randomi -12, 0, 1; ... for the filtered and the delayed signal
aOut = aFilt*ampdb(kdbFilt) + aDel*ampdb(kdbDel); mix it
outs aOut, aOut
  endin

```

This is a filtered noise, and its delay, which is fed back again into
the delay line at a certain ratio _iFb_. The filter is moving
as _kFiltFq_ randomly between 100 and 1000 Hz. The volume of the filtered noise is
moving as _kdB_ randomly between -18 dB and -6 dB. The delay time moves
between 0.1 and 0.8 seconds, and then both signals are mixed together.

### Basic Example

If this signal processing unit is to be transformed into a User Defined
Opcode, the first question is about the extend of the code that will be
encapsulated: where the UDO code will begin and end? The first solution
could be a radical, and possibly bad, approach: to transform the whole
instrument into a UDO.

;example by joachim heintz
```

Before we continue the discussion about the quality of this
transformation, we should have a look at the syntax first. The general
syntax for a User Defined Opcode is:

    opcode name, outtypes, intypes
    ...
    endop

Here, the **name** of the UDO is **FiltFb**. You are free to use any
name, but it is suggested that you begin the name with a capital letter.
By doing this, you avoid duplicating the name of most of the
pre-existing opcodes which normally start with a lower case letter.
As we have no input arguments and no output arguments for this first
version of FiltFb, both **outtypes** and **intypes** are set to zero.

Similar to the [instr](http://www.csound.com/docs/manual/instr.html) ...
[endin](http://www.csound.com/docs/manual/endin.html)
block of a normal instrument definition, for a UDO the **opcode ...
endop** keywords begin and end the UDO definition block. In the
instrument, the UDO is called like a normal opcode by using its name,
and in the same line the input arguments are listed on the right and the
output arguments on the left. In the previous a example, _FiltFb_ has
no input and output arguments so it is called by just using its name:

    instr 1
     FiltFb
    endin

Now - why is this UDO more or less useless? It achieves nothing, when
compared to the original non UDO version, and in fact looses some of the
advantages of the instrument defined version. Firstly, it is not
advisable to include this line in the UDO:

    out       aOut, aOut

This statement writes the audio signal aOut from inside the UDO to the
output device. Imagine you want to change the output channels, or you
want to add any signal modifier after the opcode. This would be
impossible with this statement. So instead of including the _out_
opcode, we give the _FiltFb_ UDO an audio output:

    xout      aOut

The [xout](http://www.csound.com/docs/manual/xout.html) statement
of a UDO definition works like the "outlets" in PD or Max,
sending the result(s) of an opcode back to the caller instrument.

Now let us consider the UDO's input arguments, choose which processes
should be carried out within the _FiltFb_ unit, and what aspects would
offer greater flexibility if controllable from outside the UDO. First,
the **aSnd** parameter should not be restricted to a white noise with
amplitude 0.2, but should be an input (like a "signal inlet" in
PD/Max). This is implemented using the line:

    aSnd      xin

Both the output and the input type must be declared in the first line of
the UDO definition, whether they are i-, k- or a-variables. So instead
of `opcode FiltFb, 0, 0` the statement has changed now
to `opcode FiltFb, a, a`, because we have both input and output as a-variable.

The UDO is now much more flexible and logical: it takes any audio input,
it performs the filtered delay and feedback processing, and returns the
result as another audio signal. In the next example, instrument 1 does
exactly the same as before. Instrument 2 has live input instead.

### Is There an Optimal Design for a User Defined Opcode?

Is this now the optimal version of the _FiltFb_ User Defined Opcode?
Obviously there are other parts of the opcode definiton which could be
controllable from outside: the feedback multiplier **iFb**, the random
movement of the input signal **kdB**, the random movement of the filter
frequency **kFiltFq**, and the random movements of the output mix
**kdbSnd** and **kdbDel**. Is it better to put them outside of the
opcode definition, or is it better to leave them inside?

There is no general answer. It depends on the degree of abstraction you
desire or you prefer to relinquish. If you are working on a piece for
which all of the parameters settings are already defined as required in
the UDO, then control from the caller instrument may not be necessary.
The advantage of minimizing the number of input and output arguments is
the simplification in using the UDO. The more flexibility you require
from your UDO however, the greater the number of input arguments that
will be required. Providing more control is better for a later
reusability, but may be unnecessarily complicated.

Perhaps it is the best solution to have one abstract definition which
performs one task, and to create a derivative - also as UDO - fine tuned
for the particular project you are working on. The final example
demonstrates the definition of a general and more abstract
UDO _FiltFb_, and its various applications: instrument 1 defines the specifications in
the instrument itself; instrument 2 uses a second
UDO _Opus123_FiltFb_ for this purpose; instrument 3 sets the
general _FiltFb_ in a new context of two varying delay lines with a buzz sound as input signal.

The good thing about the different possibilities of writing a more
specified UDO, or a more generalized: You needn't decide this at the
beginning of your work. Just start with any formulation you find useful
in a certain situation. If you continue and see that you should have
some more parameters accessible, it should be easy to rewrite the UDO.
Just be careful not to confuse the different versions you create. Use
names like Faulty1, Faulty2 etc. instead of overwriting Faulty. Making
use of extensive commenting when you initially create the UDO will make
it easier to adapt the UDO at a later time. What are the inputs
(including the measurement units they use such as Hertz or seconds)?
What are the outputs? - How you do this, is up to you and depends on
your style and your preference.

## How to Use the User Defined Opcode Facility in Practice

In this section, we will address the main points of using UDOs: what you
must bear in mind when loading them, what special features they offer,
what restrictions you must be aware of and how you can build your own
language with them.

### Loading User Defined Opcodes in the Orchestra Header

As can be seen from the examples above, User Defined Opcodes must be
defined in the orchestra header (which is sometimes called _instrument
0_).

You can load as many User Defined Opcodes into a Csound orchestra as you
wish. As long as they do not depend on each other, their order is
arbitrarily. If UDO _Opus123_FiltFb_ uses the UDO _FiltFb_ for its
definition (see the example above), you must first load _FiltFb_, and
then _Opus123_FiltFb_. If not, you will get an error like this:

    orch compiler:
            opcode  Opus123_FiltFb  a       a
    error:  no legal opcode, line 25:
    aFilt, aDel FiltFb    aSnd, iFb, kFiltFq, iQ, 1, aDelTm

### Loading by an #include File

Definitions of User Defined Opcodes can also be loaded into a .csd file
by an [#include](https://csound.com/docs/manual/include.html) statement.
What you must do is the following:

1.  Save your opcode definitions in a plain text file, for instance
    _MyOpcodes.txt_.
2.  If this file is in the same directory as your .csd file, you can
    just call it by the statement:

        #include "MyOpcodes.txt"

3.  If _MyOpcodes.txt_ is in a different directory, you must call it
    by the full path name, for instance:

        #include "/Users/me/Documents/Csound/UDO/MyOpcodes.txt"

As always, make sure that the _#include_ statement is the last one in
the orchestra header, and that the logical order is accepted if one
opcode depends on another.

If you work with User Defined Opcodes a lot, and build up a collection
of them, the _#include_ feature allows you easily import several or all
of them to your .csd file.

### The setksmps Feature

The [ksmps](http://www.csound.com/docs/manual/ksmps.html) assignment
in the orchestra header cannot be changed during the
performance of a .csd file. But in a User Defined Opcode you have the
possibility of changing this value by a local assignment. If you
use a [setksmps](http://www.csound.com/docs/manual/setksmps.html)
statement in your UDO, you can have a locally smaller value for the
number of samples per control cycle in the UDO. In the following
example, the print statement in the UDO prints ten times compared to one
time in the instrument, because ksmps in the UDO is 10 times smaller:

#### **_EXAMPLE 03G06_UDO_setksmps.csd_**

```csound
<CsoundSynthesizer>
<CsOptions>
-nm0
</CsOptions>
<CsInstruments>
sr = 44100
ksmps = 44100 ;very high because of printing

  opcode Faster, 0, 0
setksmps 4410 ;local ksmps is 1/10 of global ksmps
printks "UDO print!%n", 0
  endop

  instr 1
printks "Instr print!%n", 0 ;print each control period (once per second)
Faster ;print 10 times per second because of local ksmps
  endin

</CsInstruments>

i 1 0 2

```

### Default Arguments

For i-time arguments, you can use a simple feature to set default
values:

- _o_ (instead of _i_) defaults to 0
- _p_ (instead of _i_) defaults to 1
- _j_ (instead of _i_) defaults to -1

For k-time arguments, you can use since Csound 5.18 these default
values:

- _O_ (instead of _k_) defaults to 0
- _P_ (instead of _k_) defaults to 1
- _V_ (instead of _k_) defaults to 0.5
- _J_ (instead of _k_) defaults to -1

So you can omit these arguments - in this case the default values will
be used. If you give an input argument instead, the default value will
be overwritten:

endin

### Overloading

Extending this example a bit shows an important feature of *UDO*s.
If we have different input and/or output types, we can use
the **same** name for the _UDO_. Csound will choose the appropriate version
depending on the context. This is a well-known practice in many
programming languages as _overloading a function_.

In the simple example below, the _i_-rate and the _k_-rate version of
the UDO are both called _Default_. Depending on the variable type and the
number of outputs, the correct version is used by Csound.

### Recursive User Defined Opcodes

Recursion means that a function can call itself. This is a feature which
can be useful in many situations. Also User Defined Opcodes can be
recursive. You can do many things with a recursive UDO which you cannot
do in any other way; at least not in a simliarly simple way. This is an
example of generating seven partials by a recursive UDO. See the last
example in the next section for a more musical application of a
recursive UDO.

As seen in this example, instruments can do recursion, too.
Here we set a number of repetitions in p4. As long as this number has not
reached 1, the next instance is called after this instance has finished.

## Examples

We will focus here on some examples which will hopefully show the wide
range of User Defined Opcodes. Some of them are adaptions of examples
from previous chapters about the Csound Syntax.

### Play A Mono Or Stereo Soundfile

Csound is often very strict and gives errors where other applications
might _turn a blind eye_. This is also the case if you read a
soundfile using Csound's [diskin](http://www.csound.com/docs/manual/diskin.html) opcode.
If your soundfile is mono, you must use the mono version, which has one
audio signal as output. If your soundfile is stereo, you must use the
stereo version, which outputs two audio signals. If you want a stereo
output, but you happen to have a mono soundfile as input, you will get
the error message:

    INIT ERROR in ...: number of output args inconsistent with number
    of file channels

It may be more useful to have an opcode which works for both, mono and
stereo files as input. This is a ideal job for a UDO. Two versions are
implemented here by overloading.
FilePlay either returns one audio signal (if the file is
stereo it uses just the first channel), or it returns two
audio signals (if the file is mono it duplicates this to both channels).
We can use the default arguments to make this opcode behave exactly as
a _tolerant diskin_ ...

### Change the Content of a Function Table

In example _03C11_Table_random_dev.csd_, a function table has been
changed at performance time, once a second, by random deviations. This
can be easily transformed to a User Defined Opcode. It takes the
function table variable, a trigger signal, and the random deviation in
percent as input. In each control cycle where the trigger signal
is _1_, the table values are read. The random deviation is applied, and
the changed values are written again into the table.

  while kndx < ftlen(ift) do
   kval table kndx, ift; read old value
   knewval = kval + rnd31:k(kperc/100,0); calculate new value
   tablew knewval, kndx, giSine; write new value
   kndx += 1
  od
 endif

The next example permutes a series of numbers randomly each
time it is called. For this purpose, one random element of
the input array^[More precisely the random element is taken
from a *copy* of the input array. This copy is always created
by the UDO, so the original array is left untouched. This is
visible in the last line of the printout.] is taken and
written to the first position of the output array. Then all
elements which are "right of" this one random element are copied
one position to the left. As result the previously chosen
element is being overwritten, and the number of values to read is
shrinked by one. This process is done again and again, until
each _old_ element has placed to a (potentially) _new_ position in the
resulting output array.

  ;get one random element and put it in iOutArr
  iRndIndx    =        int(random:i(0, iReadLen-.0001))
  iOutArr[iWriteIndx] = iInArr[iRndIndx]
  ;shift the elements after this one to the left
  while iRndIndx < iReadLen-1 do
   iInArr[iRndIndx] =  iInArr[iRndIndx+1]
   iRndIndx   +=       1

### A Recursive User Defined Opcode for Additive Synthesis

Smilar to example 03F11 we synthesize here a number of partials,
and add a random frequency deviation to it. We use a maximum possible
deviation of plus/minus three semitones compared to the harmonic frequencies.
Also we apply a unique duration for each partial. This is written as a
recursive UDO. Each UDO generates one partial, and calls the UDO again
until the last partial is generated. The _Main_ instrument itself
performs the time loop as recursion, calculating the basic
values for one note and performing the event. Here the recursive call is
limited by time: After 60 seconds no more calls to the _Main_ instrument,
but instead to another instrument which exits Csound by a score "e"
statement.

### Filter implementation via Sample-by-Sample Processing

At the end of chapter 03A the ability of sample-by-sample processing has
been shown at some basic examples. This feature is really substantial
for writing digital filters. This can perfectly be done in the Csound
language itself. The next example shows an implementation of the zero
delay state variable filter by Steven Yi. In his collection at
[www.github.com/kunstmusik/libsyi](www.github.com/kunstmusik/libsyi)
more details and other implementaions can be found. --- Note also that
this code is another example of overloading a UDO definition. The same opcode
name is defined here twice; first with the input types aKK (one audio
signal and two k-signals with initialization), then with the input types
aaa.
