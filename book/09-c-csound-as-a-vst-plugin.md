# 09 C. CSOUND AS A VST PLUGIN

Csound can be built into a VST or AU plugin through the use of the
Csound host API. Refer to the section on using the Csound API for more
details.

The best choice currently is to use [Cabbage](https://www.cabbageaudio.com) to create Csound based plugins. See the [Cabbage chapter](10-b-cabbage.md) in part 10 of this manual.
