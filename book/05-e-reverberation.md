# 05 E. REVERBERATION

Reverb is the effect a room or space has on a sound where the sound we
perceive is a mixture of the direct sound and the dense overlapping
echoes of that sound reflecting off walls and objects within the space.

Csound's earliest reverb opcodes are _reverb_ and _nreverb_. By
today's standards they sound rather crude and as a consequence modern
Csound users tend to prefer the more recent opcodes _freeverb_ and
_reverbsc_.

The typical way to use a reverb is to run as a effect throughout the
entire Csound performance and to send it audio from other instruments to
which it adds reverb. This is more efficient than initiating a new
reverb effect for every note that is played. This arrangement is a
reflection of how a reverb effect would be used with a mixing desk in a
conventional studio. There are several methods of sending audio from
sound producing instruments to the reverb instrument, three of which
will be introduced in the coming examples

The _first_ method uses Csound's _global variables_, so that an audio
variable created in one instrument can be read in another instrument.
There are several points to highlight here. First the global audio
variable that is used to send audio to the reverb instrument is
initialized to zero (silence) in the header area of the orchestra.

This is done so that if no sound generating instruments are playing at
the beginning of the performance this variable still exists and has a
value. An error would result otherwise and Csound would not run. When
audio is written into this variable in the sound generating instrument
it is added to the current value of the global variable.

This is done in order to permit polyphony and so that the state of this
variable created by other sound producing instruments is not
overwritten. Finally it is important that the global variable is cleared
(assigned a value of zero) when it is finished with at the end of the
reverb instrument. If this were not done then the variable would quickly
_explode_ (get astronomically high) as all previous instruments are
merely adding values to it rather that redeclaring it. Clearing could be
done simply by setting to zero but the _clear_ opcode might prove useful
in the future as it provides us with the opportunity to clear many
variables simultaneously.

This example uses the
[freeverb](https://csound.com/docs/manual/freeverb.html) opcode and
is based on a plugin of the same name. Freeverb has a smooth reverberant
tail and is perhaps similar in sound to a plate reverb. It provides us
with two main parameters of control: _room size_ which is essentially
a control of the amount of internal feedback and therefore reverb time,
and _high frequency damping_ which controls the amount of attenuation
of high frequencies. Both these parameters should be set within the
range 0 to 1. For room size a value of zero results in a very short
reverb and a value of 1 results in a very long reverb. For high
frequency damping a value of zero provides minimum damping of higher
frequencies giving the impression of a space with hard walls, a value of
1 provides maximum high frequency damping thereby giving the impression
of a space with soft surfaces such as thick carpets and heavy curtains.

The _second method_ uses Csound's _zak patching system_ to send audio from
one instrument to another. The zak system is a little like a patch bay
you might find in a recording studio. Zak channels can be a, k or
i-rate. These channels will be addressed using numbers so it will be
important to keep track of what each numbered channel is used for. Our
example will be very simple in that we will only be using one zak audio
channel. Before using any of the zak opcodes for reading and writing
data we must initialize zak storage space. This is done in the orchestra
header area using the
[zakinit](https://csound.com/docs/manual/zakinit.html) opcode. This
opcode initializes both a and k rate channels; we must intialize at
least one of each even if we don't require both.

```csound
zakinit    1, 1
```

The audio from the sound generating instrument is mixed into a zak audio
channel the [zawm](https://csound.com/docs/manual/zawm.html) opcode
like this:

```csound
zawm    aSig * iRvbSendAmt, 1
```

This channel is read from in the reverb instrument using the
[zar](https://csound.com/docs/manual/zar.html) opcode like this:

```csound
aInSig  zar   1
```

Because audio is begin mixed into our zak channel but it is never
redefined (only mixed into) it needs to be cleared after we have
finished with it. This is accomplished at the bottom of the reverb
instrument using the
[zacl](https://csound.com/docs/manual/zacl.html) opcode like this:

    zacl      0, 1

This example uses the
[reverbsc](https://csound.com/docs/manual/reverbsc.html) opcode. It
too has a stereo input and output. The arguments that define its
character are feedback level and cutoff frequency. Feedback level should
be in the range zero to 1 and controls reverb time. Cutoff frequency
should be within the range of human hearing (20Hz -20kHz) and less than
the Nyqvist frequency (sr/2) - it controls the cutoff frequencies of low
pass filters within the algorithm.

_reverbsc_ contains a mechanism to modulate delay times internally which
has the effect of harmonically blurring sounds the longer they are
reverberated. This contrasts with _freeverb_'s rather static
reverberant tail. On the other hand _reverbsc_'s tail is not as smooth
as that of _freeverb,_ inidividual echoes are sometimes discernible so
it may not be as well suited to the reverberation of percussive sounds.
Also be aware that as well as reducing the reverb time, the feedback
level parameter reduces the overall amplitude of the effect to the point
where a setting of 1 will result in silence from the opcode.

As _third method_, a more recent option for sending sound from instrument to instrument in
Csound is to use the _chn..._ opcodes. These opcodes can also be used
to allow Csound to interface with external programs using the software
bus and the Csound API.

## The Schroeder Reverb Design

Many reverb algorithms including Csound's _freeverb_, _reverb_ and _nreverb_
are based on what is known as the Schroeder reverb design. This was a
design proposed in the early 1960s by the physicist Manfred Schroeder.
In the Schroeder reverb a signal is passed into four parallel comb
filters the outputs of which are summed and then passed through two
allpass filters as shown in the diagram below. Essentially the comb
filters provide the body of the reverb effect and the allpass filters
smear their resultant sound to reduce ringing artefacts the comb filters
might produce. More modern designs might extent the number of filters
used in an attempt to create smoother results. The freeverb opcode
employs eight parallel comb filters followed by four series allpass
filters on each channel. The two main indicators of poor implementations
of the Schoeder reverb are individual echoes being excessively apparent
and ringing artefacts. The results produced by the freeverb opcode are
very smooth but a criticism might be that it is lacking in character and
is more suggestive of a plate reverb than of a real room.

![](../resources/images/05-e-soundmod-schroeder.jpg)

The next example implements the basic Schroeder reverb with four
parallel comb filters followed by three series allpass filters. This
also proves a useful exercise in routing audio signals within Csound.
Perhaps the most crucial element of the Schroeder reverb is the choice
of loop times for the comb and allpass filters -- careful choices here
should obviate the undesirable artefacts mentioned in the previous
paragraph. If loop times are too long individual echoes will become
apparent, if they are too short the characteristic ringing of comb
filters will become apparent. If loop times between filters differ too
much the outputs from the various filters will not fuse. It is also
important that the loop times are prime numbers so that echoes between
different filters do not reinforce each other. It may also be necessary
to adjust loop times when implementing very short reverbs or very long
reverbs. The duration of the reverb is effectively determined by the
reverb times for the comb filters. There is certainly scope for
experimentation with the design of this example and exploration of
settings other than the ones suggested here.

This example consists of five instruments. The fifth instrument
implements the reverb algorithm described above. The first four
instruments act as a kind of generative drum machine to provide source
material for the reverb. Generally sharp percussive sounds provide the
sternest test of a reverb effect. Instrument 1 triggers the various
synthesized drum sounds (bass drum, snare and closed hi-hat) produced by
instruments 2 to 4.

This chapter has introduced some of the more recent Csound opcodes for
delay-line based reverb algorithms which in most situations can be used
to provide high quality and efficient reverberation. Convolution offers
a whole new approach for the creation of realistic reverbs that imitate
actual spaces - this technique is demonstrated in the
[Convolution](05-h-convolution.md) chapter.
