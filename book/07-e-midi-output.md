# 07 E. MIDI OUTPUT

Csound's ability to output midi data in real-time can open up many
possibilities. We can relay the Csound score to a hardware synthesizer
so that _it_ plays the notes in our score, instead of a Csound
instrument. We can algorithmically generate streams of notes within the
orchestra and have these played by the external device. We could even
route midi data internally to another piece of software. Csound could be
used as a device to transform incoming midi data, transforming,
transposing or arpeggiating incoming notes before they are output again.
Midi output could also be used to preset faders on a motorized fader box
to desired initial locations.

## Initiating Realtime MIDI Output

The command line flag for realtime midi output is&nbsp;
[-Q](https://csound.com/docs/manual/CommandFlags.html#FlagsMinusUpperQ).
Just as when
setting up an audio input or output device or a midi input device we
must define the desired device number after the flag. When in doubt what
midi output devices we have on our system we can always specify an _out
of range_ device number (e.g. -Q999) in which case Csound will not run
but will instead give an error and provide us with a list of available
devices and their corresponding numbers. We can then insert an
appropriate device number.

## _midiout_ - Outputting Raw MIDI Data

The analog of the opcode for the input of raw midi
data, [midiin](https://csound.com/docs/manual/midiin.html),
is [midiout](https://csound.com/docs/manual/midiout.html). It
will output a midi message with its given input arguments once every _k
period_ - this could very quickly lead to clogging of incoming midi data
in the device to which midi is begin sent unless measures are taken to
restrain its output. In the following example this is dealt with by
turning off the instrument as soon as the _midiout_ line has been
executed just once by using
the [turnoff](https://csound.com/docs/manual/turnoff.html) opcode.
Alternative approaches would be to set the status byte to zero after the
first _k pass_ or to embed the _midiout_ within a conditional
(_if - then_)^[See chapter [03 C](03-c-control-structures.md) for details.]
so that its rate of execution can be controlled in some way.

Another thing we need to be aware of is that midi notes do not contain
any information about note duration; instead the device playing the note
waits until it receives a corresponding note-off instruction on the same
midi channel and with the same note number before stopping the note. We
must be mindful of this when working with _midiout_. The status byte for
a midi note-off is 128 but it is more common for note-offs to be
expressed as a note-on (status byte 144) with zero velocity. In the
following example two notes (and corresponding note offs) are send to
the midi output - the first note-off makes use of the zero velocity
convention whereas the second makes use of the note-off status byte.
Hardware and software synths should respond similarly to both. One
advantage of the note-off message using status byte 128 is that we can
also send a note-off velocity, i.e. how forcefully we release the key.
Only more expensive midi keyboards actually sense and send note-off
velocity and it is even rarer for hardware to respond to received
note-off velocities in a meaningful way. Using Csound as a sound engine
we could respond to this data in a creative way however.

In order for the following example to work you must connect a midi sound
module or keyboard receiving on channel 1 to the midi output of your
computer. You will also need to set the appropriate device number after
the _-Q_ flag.

No use is made of audio so sample rate (sr), and number of channels
(nchnls) are left undefined - nonetheless they will assume default
values.

The use of separate score events for note-ons and note-offs is rather
cumbersome. It would be more sensible to use the Csound note duration
(p3) to define when the midi note-off is sent. The next example does
this by utilising a release flag generated by
the [release](https://csound.com/docs/manual/release.html) opcode
whenever a note ends and sending the note-off then.

Obviously *midiout *is not limited to only sending only midi note
information but instead this information could include continuous
controller information, pitch bend, system exclusive data and so on. The
next example, as well as playing a note, sends controller 1 (modulation)
data which rises from zero to maximum (127) across the duration of the
note. To ensure that unnessessary midi data is not sent out, the output
of the _line_ function is first converted into integers,
and _midiout_ for the continuous controller data is only executed
whenever this integer value changes. The function that creates this
stream of data goes slightly above this maximum value (it finishes at a
value of 127.1) to ensure that a rounded value of 127 is actually
achieved.

In practice it may be necessary to start sending the continuous
controller data slightly before the note-on to allow the hardware time
to respond.

## _midion_ - Outputting MIDI Notes Made Easier

*midiout *is the most powerful opcode for midi output but if we are only
interested in sending out midi notes from an instrument then
the [midion](https://csound.com/docs/manual/midion.html) opcode
simplifies the procedure as the following example demonstrates by
playing a simple major arpeggio.

Changing any of midion's k-rate input arguments in realtime will force
it to stop the current midi note and send out a new one with the new
parameters.

[midion2](https://csound.com/docs/manual/midion2.html) allows us to
control when new notes are sent (and the current note is stopped)
through the use of a trigger input. The next example uses _midion2_ to
algorithmically generate a melodic line. New note generation is
controlled by a [metro](https://csound.com/docs/manual/metro.html),
the rate of which undulates slowly through the use of
a [randomi](https://csound.com/docs/manual/randomi.html) function.

_midion_ and _midion2_ generate monophonic melody lines with no gaps
between notes.

[moscil](https://csound.com/docs/manual/moscil.html) works in a
slightly different way and allows us to explicitly define note durations
as well as the pauses between notes thereby permitting the generation of
more staccato melodic lines. Like _midion_ and _midion2_, _moscil_
&nbsp;will not generate overlapping notes (unless two or more instances of it
are concurrent). The next example algorithmically generates a melodic
line using _moscil_.

## MIDI File Output

As well as (or instead of) outputting midi in realtime, Csound can
render data from all of its midi output opcodes to a midi file. To do
this we use the _--midioutfile=_ flag followed by the desired name
for our file. For example:

    <CsOptions>
    -Q2 --midioutfile=midiout.mid
    </CsOptions>

will simultaneously stream realtime midi to midi output device number 2
and render to a file named _midiout.mid_ which will be saved in our
home directory.
